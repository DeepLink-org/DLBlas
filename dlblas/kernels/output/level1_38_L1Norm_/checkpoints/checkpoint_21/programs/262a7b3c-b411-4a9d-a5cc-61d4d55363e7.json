We note that the operation is: for each row, compute the sum of absolute values along the row (dim=1) and then divide each element in the row by that sum.\n\n 2. The Triton kernel will be designed to process rows in parallel. Each program ID (pid) will handle one row.\n\n 3. We need to compute the sum of absolute values for the entire row. Since the row might be long (dim=16384), we will use a reduction.\n\n 4. We'll use a two-pass reduction: \n    a. First, we reduce within a block to a single value per row per block (if the row is too long, we might have multiple blocks per row? but note: we are assigning one row per program id). \n    b. However, note that the row might be too long to process in one block. Therefore, we can break the row into multiple blocks and then do a second reduction across blocks? But that complicates.\n\n 5. Alternatively, we can use a two-stage kernel? But note: the problem is that the row length (16384) is fixed and known. We can set a block size (e.g., 1024 or 2048) and then have multiple blocks per row? But then we need to combine the partial sums.\n\n 6. However, the problem says: \"NEVER change grid configuration\". The current grid configuration in the reference code is implicitly (batch_size, ) because we have one row per sample. We must keep the grid as (batch_size,).\n\n 7. Therefore, we design:\n    - Each program id (pid) handles one row (batch index = pid).\n    - We break the row into multiple blocks (if necessary) and use a reduction within the row.\n\n 8. But note: the grid configuration in the reference is (batch_size,). We are not allowed to change that. Therefore, we must process the entire row in one block? However, 16384 elements might be too many for one block (max block size is 1024 for some architectures, but H100 supports up to 1024 threads per block? Actually, Triton may have a maximum block size of 2^16 per dimension? But we are using 1D). However, we are constrained by the hardware: the number of threads per block we can use is limited (e.g., 1024). Therefore, we must use a reduction that can handle a row of 16384 elements with multiple blocks? But wait: the grid is fixed to (batch_size,). How can we use multiple blocks per row? We cannot because the grid is fixed.\n\n 9. Therefore, we must process the entire row in one block? But 16384 is too big for one block (we cannot have 16384 threads in one block). So we have to break the row and use multiple blocks per row? But that would require changing the grid. However, the constraint says: \"NEVER modify grid configuration\". So we are stuck?\n\n10. Let me read the constraints again: \"NEVER modify grid configuration, output tensor shapes, or PID logic\". The PID logic here is that we have one pid per row. So we cannot change the grid to have more than batch_size blocks.\n\n11. Therefore, we must process the entire row in one block. But we can have a block with 16384 threads? Actually, the maximum number of threads per block in Triton is 1024 (for CUDA compatibility). So we cannot.\n\n12. We must then use a reduction that works within a block and then does multiple passes? Actually, we can use a for-loop to iterate over the row in chunks.\n\n13. We can design the kernel to have a fixed block size (say 1024) and then each block processes a row by having the thread iterate over the row in chunks of block size. Then we do a reduction in the block to get the sum for the row.\n\n14. Steps for the kernel:\n    pid = program_id(0)  # row index\n    We are going to have a block of threads (size BLOCK_SIZE) that will process the row.\n\n    We initialize a local sum to zero.\n\n    We loop over the columns in chunks of BLOCK_SIZE:\n        offset = i * BLOCK_SIZE + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offset < n_cols   (to avoid out-of-bound)\n        load a chunk of the row: x = tl.load(x_ptr + pid * stride_row + offset, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n        abs_x = tl.abs(x)\n        chunk_sum = tl.sum(abs_x, axis=0)   # This sums the entire chunk? Actually, we want to accumulate over the entire row.\n\n        Then we add chunk_sum to a register that holds the row sum.\n\n    Then we have the row sum in a register? But note: we are doing a reduction across the entire row. However, the chunk_sum is a scalar per block? Actually, we are in one block per row. So we can accumulate in a single variable.\n\n    However, the entire row is processed by one block? But we are using a fixed block size (BLOCK_SIZE) and we are looping. So we can do:\n\n        row_sum = 0.0\n        for i in range(0, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE):\n            offset = i + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n            mask = offset < n_cols\n            x = tl.load(...)\n            row_sum += tl.sum(tl.abs(x), axis=0)\n\n    Then we compute the normalization: output = x / row_sum. But wait: we have to store the entire row? We have to do the same loop again to write the normalized values? Because we cannot store the entire row in shared memory (if the row is too long).\n\n15. We can do:\n    - First pass: compute the row_sum (as above)\n    - Second pass: loop again over the row to load, divide by row_sum, and store.\n\n16. However, we are constrained by the memory: we have to read the entire row twice. But the reference code also does two passes? (first for abs and sum, then for division). So it's acceptable.\n\n17. We must be cautious about the precision: we are accumulating a sum of floats. We are using tl.sum which does a reduction in the block for the chunk? Actually, for each chunk, we compute the sum of absolute values and then accumulate in a scalar. The scalar accumulation might have precision issues? We can use a more stable reduction? But the row length is 16384, which is acceptable.\n\n18. Implementation:\n\n    We are going to write two kernels? Or one kernel that does two passes? We can do one kernel that does two passes.\n\n    Steps in the kernel:\n\n    pid = tl.program_id(0)   # row index\n    base = pid * stride_row   # stride_row is the stride in the x tensor for rows? We can pass the stride.\n\n    # First pass: compute row_sum\n    row_sum = 0.0\n    for offset_base in range(0, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE):\n        offsets = offset_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < n_cols\n        x_vals = tl.load(x_ptr + base + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n        abs_x = tl.abs(x_vals)\n        chunk_sum = tl.sum(abs_x, axis=0)   # This is a scalar for the entire chunk? Actually, it's a reduction across the entire chunk (within the block) -> returns one value per block? But we are in a loop and we are accumulating in row_sum. So we do:\n        row_sum += chunk_sum\n\n    # We need to synchronize? Actually, the reduction is done across the entire chunk by the block. But note: we are using a for-loop and each chunk is independent. The row_sum is a scalar in the block. We don't need synchronization because we are in a single block and the reduction is done by the hardware.\n\n    # But note: the tl.sum is a collective operation that does a reduction within the block? Yes. But we are accumulating the chunk_sum in a scalar that is held by the entire block? Actually, each thread in the block will have the same row_sum? Because the tl.sum returns the same value to every thread? Yes.\n\n    # Second pass: normalize and store\n    for offset_base in range(0, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE):\n        offsets = offset_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < n_cols\n        x_vals = tl.load(x_ptr + base + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n        normalized = x_vals / row_sum\n        tl.store(output_ptr + base + offsets, normalized, mask=mask)\n\n19. However, note: the row_sum might be zero? The reference code uses torch.sum(torch.abs(x)) and then divides. If the row_sum is zero, then we get division by zero. The reference code does not handle that? Actually, in the reference, if the row_sum is zero, then we have 0/0 -> NaN. We must mimic that.\n\n20. We can do the same: if row_sum is zero, then we get NaN.\n\n21. We must also consider the data types: the input x is float32? The reference uses torch.randn which is float32. The output should be float32.\n\n22. We are going to write a Triton kernel for the forward function.\n\n23. We need to set the grid and block. The grid is (batch_size,) as before. The block is BLOCK_SIZE (which we choose, say 1024). But note: we are iterating over the row with step BLOCK_SIZE. So we can set BLOCK_SIZE to 1024 or 2048? But note: the number of threads per block is BLOCK_SIZE. We must set it to a power of two and <= 1024? Actually, Triton might support more? But for performance, we stick to 1024.\n\n24. We will pass the stride for the row. Since the tensor is contiguous, the stride for the row is the number of columns? Actually, we can compute the stride in the kernel: we can pass the shape of the tensor? Or we can pass the stride.\n\n25. We'll pass the stride for the row (stride_row) and the number of columns (n_cols).\n\n26. We also note: the input tensor might not be contiguous? The reference code does not require contiguous? But we can require it in the Triton kernel. We can make the input contiguous in the wrapper.\n\n27. Let's design the kernel:\n\n    @triton.jit\n    def _l1norm_kernel(\n        x_ptr,                # pointer to input tensor\n        output_ptr,           # pointer to output tensor\n        stride_row,           # stride for the row (how many elements to skip to next row)\n        n_cols,               # number of columns in each row\n        BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,   # the block size for the inner dimension\n    ):\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)   # row index\n\n        # base pointer for the current row\n        row_start = pid * stride_row\n\n        # First pass: compute row_sum\n        row_sum = 0.0\n        for offset in range(0, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE):\n            cols = offset + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n            mask = cols < n_cols\n            # Load the chunk of the row\n            x_vals = tl.load(x_ptr + row_start + cols, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n            abs_x = tl.abs(x_vals)\n            # Sum the absolute values in the chunk\n            chunk_sum = tl.sum(abs_x, axis=0)   # returns a scalar (reduced over the entire chunk by the block)\n            row_sum += chunk_sum\n\n        # Second pass: normalize and store\n        for offset in range(0, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE):\n            cols = offset + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n            mask = cols < n_cols\n            x_vals = tl.load(x_ptr + row_start + cols, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n            # Normalize\n            normalized = x_vals / row_sum\n            tl.store(output_ptr + row_start + cols, normalized, mask=mask)\n\n28. Then in the model, we call this kernel.\n\n29. We must set the grid and block. The grid is (batch_size,) and the block is (BLOCK_SIZE,). But note: we are using a 1D grid and 1D block.\n\n30. However, note: the block size we are using for the kernel is (BLOCK_SIZE,). But we are iterating over the row? Actually, the entire row is processed by one block? And the block has BLOCK_SIZE threads. So we are using one block per row. But if the row has 16384 elements, then we are using 1024 threads per block and we loop 16 times? That is acceptable.\n\n31. We must choose BLOCK_SIZE appropriately. We can set it to 1024.\n\n32. We must also handle the case when n_cols is not a multiple of BLOCK_SIZE? The mask handles that.\n\n33. We are going to write the ModelNew class:\n\n    class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super().__init__()\n\n        def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n            # Ensure contiguous\n            x = x.contiguous()\n            output = torch.empty_like(x)\n            n_rows, n_cols = x.shape[0], x.shape[1]\n\n            # We are using a fixed block size for the inner dimension\n            BLOCK_SIZE = 1024   # can be tuned? but we are not autotuning for now\n\n            # Grid is (n_rows,)\n            grid = (n_rows,)\n\n            # We need to compute the stride for the row: for a contiguous tensor, stride(0) is n_cols? \n            # Actually, for a 2D contiguous tensor, stride(0) = n_cols, stride(1)=1.\n            stride_row = x.stride(0)\n\n            # Call the kernel\n            _l1norm_kernel[grid](x, output, stride_row, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n            return output\n\n34. We must also define the kernel above.\n\n35. However, note: the reduction in the first pass (tl.sum) is a reduction within the block. We are accumulating the row_sum in a variable that is shared by all threads? Actually, the tl.sum returns the same value to every thread. Then when we do row_sum += chunk_sum, every thread is doing the same addition? That is correct because we want the same row_sum for all threads.\n\n36. But note: we are going to use row_sum in the second pass. Every thread in the block has the same row_sum? Yes.\n\n37. We must be cautious about the second loop: each thread will compute its own normalized value and store it.\n\n38. We must also note: the row_sum might be zero? Then we get NaN. That matches the reference.\n\n39. Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n40. We also note: the reference code uses keepdim=True, so the sum is of shape (batch_size, 1). We are effectively doing the same: we have one row_sum per row.\n\n41. We must test with a small tensor? But we are not allowed to change the get_inputs? We are only allowed to change the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n42. We are going to replace the entire ModelNew class and the functions? Actually, the get_inputs and get_init_inputs are outside the class. We are going to keep them? The problem says: \"Provide the complete new program code\" in the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n43. We are going to write:\n\n    import triton\n    import triton.language as tl\n\n    # Then the kernel and the ModelNew.\n\n44. We must note: the original code did not have triton imports. We are adding them.\n\n45. Also, the batch_size and dim are defined as 16 and 16384. We keep them.\n\n46. We write the kernel and the model.\n\n47. We set the BLOCK_SIZE as a constant for now (1024). We could make it a power of two that is at least 128? And we can set it to min(1024, n_cols) but n_cols is 16384, so 1024 is safe.\n\n48. We also note: the kernel must be jit compiled. We use @triton.jit.\n\n49. We must consider the performance: we are reading the entire tensor twice. The reference also does two passes? (one for abs and sum, then one for division). So the memory traffic is the same. But we are doing it in a more parallel way? Actually, the reference uses vectorized operations. The Triton kernel might be faster because it fuses the two passes and uses block reduction? And it is executed in parallel for each row.\n\n50. We hope for a speedup.\n\n51. Let's write the code.\n\nNote: We are replacing the entire EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\nWe are also keeping the same get_inputs and get_init_inputs.\n\nWe are adding the triton and tl imports.\n\nWe are defining the kernel inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK? Yes, because the entire code must be self-contained.\n\nBut note: the program might be run multiple times? We must avoid redefining the kernel? Actually, Triton caches the kernels.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n</think>\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef _l1norm_kernel(\n    x_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    stride_row,\n    n_cols,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(0)\n    row_start = pid * stride_row\n    \n    row_sum = 0.0\n    for offset in range(0, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE):\n        cols = offset + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = cols < n_cols\n        x_vals = tl.load(x_ptr + row_start + cols, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n        abs_x = tl.abs(x_vals)\n        chunk_sum = tl.sum(abs_x, axis=0)\n        row_sum += chunk_sum\n\n    for offset in range(0, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE):\n        cols = offset + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = cols < n_cols\n        x_vals = tl.load(x_ptr + row_start + cols, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n        normalized = x_vals / row_sum\n        tl.store(output_ptr + row_start + cols, normalized, mask=mask)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n\n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        x = x.contiguous()\n        output = torch.empty_like(x)\n        n_rows, n_cols = x.shape[0], x.shape[1]\n        grid = (n_rows,)\n        BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n        \n        _l1norm_kernel[grid](\n            x, output,\n            stride_row=x.stride(0),\n            n_cols=n_cols,\n            BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE\n        )\n        return output\n\nbatch_size = 16\ndim = 16384\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    x = torch.randn(batch_size, dim)\n    return [x]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

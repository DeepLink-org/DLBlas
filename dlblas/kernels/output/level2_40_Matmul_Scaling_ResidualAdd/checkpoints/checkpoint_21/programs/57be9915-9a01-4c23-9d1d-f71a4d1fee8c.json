Linear transformation (matmul) with `nn.Linear`\n  2. Clones the output and detaches (so no gradient) to get `original_x`\n  3. Scales the output by `scaling_factor`\n  4. Adds the original (detached) tensor to the scaled output.\n\nThe current implementation uses `nn.Linear` which is efficient on GPU but the subsequent operations (clone, detach, scaling, addition) are done in a naive way.\n\nHowever, note that the current code is already in PyTorch and we are asked to rewrite it for better performance. The key observation is that the entire forward pass can be expressed as:\n  x = matmul(x)   # [batch, in_features] -> [batch, out_features]\n  x = x * scaling_factor + x   # but wait, note that we are using a detached clone? \n\nBut note: the original code does:\n  original_x = x.clone().detach()   # This breaks the gradient flow for the residual part? Actually, it's not used in a way that breaks the entire gradient because the residual is detached.\n\nHowever, the current implementation is inefficient because:\n  - It does an unnecessary clone and detach. We can avoid that by just using the tensor twice, but note: we cannot use the same tensor without detaching because then the gradient would flow through both paths? Actually, the original code breaks the gradient for the residual branch. \n\nBut let's analyze the computation graph:\n  Let A = self.matmul(x)   [requires_grad=True]\n  Then we create B = A.clone().detach()   [requires_grad=False]\n  Then we compute: output = A * scaling_factor + B\n\nSo the gradient of the output w.r.t. A is only from the scaling branch? The residual branch is detached.\n\nTherefore, we can rewrite without the clone and detach by simply doing:\n  output = A * scaling_factor + A.detach()\n\nBut note: the operation `A.detach()` is just a view and does not require a copy until it is written to. However, the addition of two tensors (one requiring grad and one not) will create a new tensor that requires grad (with the gradient coming only from the scaled part).\n\nAlternatively, we can express the entire operation as:\n  output = A * (scaling_factor + 1)   ??? \nBut wait, that would be: \n  A * scaling_factor + A = A * (scaling_factor + 1)\n\nHowever, note that in the original code, the residual branch is detached. So if we do:\n  output = A * (scaling_factor + 1)\n\nThen the entire A would be in the gradient. But in the original, the residual branch is detached so the gradient of the residual branch is zero. Therefore, the two are not equivalent.\n\nSo we must break the residual branch from the gradient. We can do:\n  output = A * scaling_factor + A.detach()\n\nThis is mathematically equivalent and avoids the clone (which is a memory copy). However, note that `A.detach()` returns a view that shares storage, so it is cheap.\n\nBut the original code did a clone and then detach. The clone copies the data, which is expensive. We can avoid that by just using `A.detach()` without clone? \n\nWhy was there a clone? Because without clone, if we do:\n  original_x = x   and then we do x = x * scaling_factor, then original_x would change? \n\nBut in the original code, the operations are:\n  x = self.matmul(x)   -> now x is the output of the linear\n  original_x = x.clone().detach()   -> creates a copy and detaches\n  x = x * scaling_factor   -> modifies x in-place? Actually, no: because `*` is not in-place. So it creates a new tensor.\n\nSo the original code does:\n  step1: A = matmul(x)\n  step2: B = A.clone().detach()   [copy of A, detached]\n  step3: C = A * scaling_factor   [new tensor]\n  step4: D = C + B\n\nWe can avoid the copy by not doing the clone. We can do:\n  B = A.detach()   # this is a view, but then when we do C = A * scaling_factor, that's a new tensor. Then D = C + B.\n\nBut note: during the forward pass, if we do:\n  B = A.detach()\n  C = A * scaling_factor\n  D = C + B\n\nThis does not require a copy of A until we do the operation that uses A in two different ways? Actually, no: because A is used for two different outputs (B and C) but the backward of A for the branch that becomes B is blocked. \n\nHowever, the memory for A is still kept for the backward of the scaling branch? So we are not saving memory by avoiding the clone? Actually, the clone was an extra memory allocation. So by removing the clone we save memory and time.\n\nBut note: the original code used `x.clone().detach()`, which is a common pattern to break the graph and also avoid any in-place modification issues. However, in this case, since we are not modifying the original A in-place, we don't need the clone.\n\nTherefore, we can change:\n  original_x = x.clone().detach()\nto\n  original_x = x.detach()\n\nThis avoids the clone and should be faster.\n\nAlternatively, we can write the entire operation without intermediate steps:\n\n  x = self.matmul(x)\n  x = x * self.scaling_factor + x.detach()\n\nBut note: the original code returns the result, and the original code did not change the variable name.\n\nSo the rewritten forward would be:\n\n  def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.matmul(x)\n        # Instead of cloning and detaching, just detach (without clone) to avoid the copy\n        original_x = x.detach()\n        x = x * self.scaling_factor\n        x = x + original_x\n        return x\n\nBut we can also combine the last two lines:\n\n  x = x * self.scaling_factor + x.detach()\n\nHowever, we must be cautious: the original code did the operation in two steps and then reassigned to x. But that is not an issue.\n\nBut note: the original code did `x = x * self.scaling_factor` and then `x = x + original_x`. This is two kernels. We can fuse these two operations? However, PyTorch will likely fuse the two pointwise operations automatically. So it's not a big win.\n\nThe main win is avoiding the clone.\n\nLet's rewrite the forward method accordingly.\n\nAdditionally, note that the model is being run on GPU and we are looking for performance. The `nn.Linear` is already efficient. The rest are pointwise operations that are memory bound. Therefore, reducing the memory operations (by avoiding the clone) should help.\n\nWe'll also note that the current program defines a batch size, in_features, out_features, and scaling_factor as global variables, and then two functions `get_inputs` and `get_init_inputs`. We must keep these because they are used by the evaluation pipeline.\n\nTherefore, the new code:\n\n  class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n      ... same __init__ ...\n      def forward(self, x):\n          x = self.matmul(x)\n          # Avoid the expensive clone by using detach without clone\n          original_x = x.detach()\n          x = x * self.scaling_factor\n          x = x + original_x\n          return x\n\nBut we can also write:\n\n  def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.matmul(x)\n        # Use a single expression to avoid an extra assignment? \n        x = x * self.scaling_factor + x.detach()\n        return x\n\nThis is more concise and might be slightly faster because we are doing the two pointwise operations in one kernel? (PyTorch might fuse them anyway). Let's do this.\n\nSo the entire code becomes:\n\n  import torch\n  import torch.nn as nn\n\n  class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n      def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, scaling_factor):\n          super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n          self.matmul = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)\n          self.scaling_factor = scaling_factor\n\n      def forward(self, x):\n          x = self.matmul(x)\n          x = x * self.scaling_factor + x.detach()\n          return x\n\n  batch_size = 128\n  in_features = 64\n  out_features = 128\n  scaling_factor = 0.5\n\n  def get_inputs():\n      return [torch.randn(batch_size, in_features)]\n\n  def get_init_inputs():\n      return [in_features, out_features, scaling_factor]\n\nWe are only changing the forward method.\n\nLet's output the code accordingly.\n\nNote: We are not introducing Triton here because the problem is about a PyTorch model and the current code is in PyTorch. The example provided was about quantization and used Triton, but the current task is about a simple PyTorch model. The instructions mentioned Triton because the overall goal is to write Triton kernels, but the current program is entirely in PyTorch. \n\nHowever, looking at the evolution history, it seems the previous attempts are also in PyTorch. And the task says: \"Rewrite the program to improve its performance\".\n\nGiven the constraints, we are making a minimal change to avoid the clone and detach, replacing it with a simple detach.\n\nWe are not changing the inputs or outputs.\n\nWe are keeping the same class name and module structure.\n\nWe are also keeping the global variables and helper functions.\n\nTherefore, the rewritten code is as below.\n</think>\n```python\n\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"\n    A model that performs a matrix multiplication, scaling, and residual addition.\n\n    Args:\n        in_features (int): Number of input features.\n        out_features (int): Number of output features.\n        scaling_factor (float): Scaling factor to apply after matrix multiplication.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, scaling_factor):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.matmul = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)\n        self.scaling_factor = scaling_factor\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        \"\"\"\n        Forward pass of the model.\n\n        Args:\n            x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of shape (batch_size, in_features).\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: Output tensor of shape (batch_size, out_features).\n        \"\"\"\n        x = self.matmul(x)\n        # Use detach() instead of clone().detach() to avoid unnecessary memory copy\n        original_x = x.detach()\n        x = x * self.scaling_factor\n        x = x + original_x\n        return x\n\nbatch_size = 128\nin_features = 64\nout_features = 128\nscaling_factor = 0.5\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    return [torch.randn(batch_size, in_features)]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return [in_features, out_features, scaling_factor]\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

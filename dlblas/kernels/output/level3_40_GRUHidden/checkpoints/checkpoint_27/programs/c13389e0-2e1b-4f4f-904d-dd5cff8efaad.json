{"id": "c13389e0-2e1b-4f4f-904d-dd5cff8efaad", "code": "<think>\nWe are given a program that uses Triton for a GRU step kernel. The current program fails with a correctness error and has a score of 10.0000 (which is the base score for compilation but failing correctness). The error in the verify_payload is a ValueError: \"Conflicting meta-parameters: BLOCK_HS. Make sure that you don't re-define auto-tuned symbols.\"\n\nLooking at the kernel, we see that the `gru_step_kernel` is autotuned with the key `hidden_size` and uses a parameter `BLOCK_HS`. However, in the forward pass, we are passing `BLOCK_HS=triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)`. The autotuner expects to tune `BLOCK_HS` but we are passing it as an argument. This causes a conflict because the autotuner will try to set `BLOCK_HS` as a tuning parameter, but we are also passing it as an explicit argument.\n\nThe solution is to remove the explicit passing of `BLOCK_HS` in the kernel call. The autotuner will handle setting the value of `BLOCK_HS` based on the configurations and the key.\n\nAdditionally, we must note that the kernel uses `tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size)` and `tl.arange(0, hidden_size)`. The problem is that the range must be a power of two. We can fix this by rounding up the range to the next power of two and then using a mask.\n\nHowever, the error we are currently facing is about conflicting meta-parameters. Therefore, let's first remove the explicit `BLOCK_HS` argument from the kernel call.\n\nWe also note that the kernel uses `libdevice.tanhf` for the tanh activation. This is acceptable, but we must make sure that the Triton kernel is correctly handling the data.\n\nAnother issue: the kernel does not have any masking for the loads. The hidden size might not be a power of two, so we must mask the operations that involve vectors of length `3 * hidden_size` and `hidden_size`. We see that the kernel loads for `input_proj` and `h_prev` are done without masks. Similarly, the loop for `hidden_proj` does not mask the loads for `col_i` and `bias` (if present). We must add masks to avoid out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nLet's break down the required changes:\n\n1. Remove the explicit `BLOCK_HS` argument from the kernel call in the forward pass.\n2. In the kernel, we must use masks for all loads and stores that depend on the hidden size, because the actual hidden size might not be a power of two. We are currently using `tl.arange(0, ...)` without masking against the hidden size.\n\nHowever, note that the kernel is defined with a `BLOCK_HS` that is a `tl.constexpr`. We are using it in the autotuner, but we are not using it in the kernel to block the computation. We are using loops over `hidden_size` without blocking. This might be inefficient.\n\nGiven the time, we focus on correctness and compilation.\n\nProposed changes:\n\nIn the kernel:\n- For the loads of `input_proj` and `h_prev`, we are loading vectors of length `3 * hidden_size` and `hidden_size` respectively. We must mask these loads because the actual hidden size might not be a multiple of the block size. However, note that we are rounding the range to the next power of two? Actually, we are not. We are using `tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size)`. This will fail if `3 * hidden_size` is not a power of two.\n\nWe have two options:\n  a) Change the kernel to use a block size that is the next power of two and then mask.\n  b) Change the way we launch the kernel so that we only use power-of-two sizes for the vectors.\n\nBut note the error: \"arange's range must be a power of 2\". So we must ensure that the range in `tl.arange` is a power of two.\n\nWe can do:\n  Let `BLOCK = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * hidden_size)` and then mask with `mask = tl.arange(0, BLOCK) < 3 * hidden_size`.\n\nBut wait, the kernel is already taking `BLOCK_HS` as a tuning parameter. We can use `BLOCK_HS` for the next power of two of the hidden size? Actually, the autotuner key is `hidden_size` and we are passing `BLOCK_HS` as a config. We are not using `BLOCK_HS` in the kernel for the arange. We are using `hidden_size` directly.\n\nWe must restructure the kernel:\n\nInstead of:\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size))\n\nWe can do:\n  BLOCK_INPUT = 3 * hidden_size\n  BLOCK_INPUT_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(BLOCK_INPUT)\n  idx = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_INPUT_POW2)\n  mask = idx < BLOCK_INPUT\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the hidden state.\n\nBut note: the autotuner is tuning `BLOCK_HS` but we are not using it in the kernel for the vector length. We are using it as a block size for the hidden size? Actually, we are not using it at all in the kernel body. This is a mistake.\n\nWe have two choices:\n  1. Redesign the kernel to use `BLOCK_HS` as the block size for the hidden dimension and then loop over blocks.\n  2. Remove the autotuner and instead compute the next power of two for the vector lengths and use masking.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the kernel is currently written for a single program per hidden state element? Actually, no: each program is processing an entire hidden state vector for one batch.\n\nThe kernel is launched with `grid = (batch_size,)`. Each program handles one batch element. It loads the entire input projection (3*hidden_size) and the entire previous hidden state (hidden_size). Then it does a loop over the hidden_size to compute the hidden_proj.\n\nThis is inefficient because the loop over hidden_size is sequential. But we are in a kernel that is already per batch element.\n\nTo fix the power-of-two issue, we must change the loads to use a rounded-up size and mask.\n\nWe are going to do:\n\n  BLOCK_INPUT = 3 * hidden_size\n  BLOCK_INPUT_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(BLOCK_INPUT)\n  idx_input = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_INPUT_POW2)\n  mask_input = idx_input < BLOCK_INPUT\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the hidden state:\n\n  BLOCK_HIDDEN = hidden_size\n  BLOCK_HIDDEN_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(BLOCK_HIDDEN)\n  idx_hidden = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_HIDDEN_POW2)\n  mask_hidden = idx_hidden < BLOCK_HIDDEN\n  h_prev = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, mask=mask_hidden, other=0.0)\n\nBut note: the hidden_proj computation loops over `i in range(0, hidden_size)`. This is scalar and we cannot change that easily. However, the load for `h_i` is just one element, so it doesn't require a vector. The load for `col_i` is a vector of length 3*hidden_size. We must do the same masking for that vector.\n\nWe can change the loop to use a block of columns? But that would complicate. Alternatively, we can make sure that the hidden_size is a power of two? But we cannot assume that.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the kernel to not use vector loads for the entire input_proj and h_prev. Instead, we can loop over the hidden_size in blocks and use vector loads for blocks. But that would be a major rewrite.\n\nGiven the time, we focus on fixing the immediate errors:\n\n1. Remove the explicit `BLOCK_HS` from the kernel call to avoid the autotune conflict.\n2. Change the vector loads to use the next power of two and masks to avoid the non-power-of-two error.\n\nWe will remove the autotuner for now because the kernel is not using the `BLOCK_HS` in the body. We can reintroduce autotuning later if we block the computation.\n\nBut note: the kernel is currently autotuned with `BLOCK_HS` and the key `hidden_size`. We are not using `BLOCK_HS` in the kernel. This is a mistake. We can remove the autotuner for now to make progress.\n\nAlternatively, we can use `BLOCK_HS` as the next power of two for the hidden_size and then use it in the masking. Let's try that.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Let BLOCK_HS be the next power of two of the hidden_size. Then in the kernel, we use:\n      input_size_total = 3 * hidden_size\n      input_block = triton.next_power_of_2(input_size_total)\n      ... and similarly for the hidden vector.\n\nBut we are passing `BLOCK_HS` as a configuration parameter. We can instead compute it as the next power of two of the hidden_size and then use it for the vector length.\n\nHowever, the autotuner is setting `BLOCK_HS` to values like 128, 256, etc. We cannot use those as the next power of two for the hidden_size because the hidden_size is fixed. So we must remove the autotuner.\n\nGiven the complexity, I propose to remove the autotuner and instead compute the required next power of two inside the kernel for the vector lengths. But note: the next_power_of_2 function is not available in the kernel. So we must pass it as a constant.\n\nWe can pass the next power of two for the hidden_size and for 3*hidden_size as kernel arguments. But note the kernel already has `hidden_size` as a constant. We can compute the next power of two for the vectors:\n\n  BLOCK_INPUT_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * hidden_size)\n  BLOCK_HIDDEN_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(hidden_size)\n\nThen in the kernel, we use these for the arange and mask.\n\nBut we cannot compute `triton.next_power_of_2` inside the kernel? We can precompute it on the host and pass it as a constant.\n\nSo in the forward pass, we compute:\n  block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n  block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\n\nAnd then pass these as new constants to the kernel.\n\nBut the kernel is already taking `hidden_size` and `has_bias`. We can add two new constants: `block_input` and `block_hidden`.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute these in the kernel? The `hidden_size` is a constant, so we can do:\n  block_input = 1 << (tl.math.ceil(tl.math.log2(3 * hidden_size)))\nBut Triton doesn't have a log2 function? Actually, we can use `tl.math.log2` and `tl.math.ceil`.\n\nHowever, it's easier to compute on the host and pass as constants.\n\nLet's restructure:\n\nWe remove the autotuner and then pass two new constants: `block_input` and `block_hidden` which are the next power of two for the input projection vector and hidden state vector.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid autotuning and just remove the autotune decorator.\n\nGiven the above, here is the plan:\n\nStep 1: Remove the autotuner decorator.\nStep 2: In the forward pass, compute:\n        block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n        block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\nStep 3: Pass these two as new arguments to the kernel.\nStep 4: In the kernel, use these block sizes for the arange and mask for the vector loads.\n\nAdditionally, we must mask the other loads in the loop for `col_i` and `bias`.\n\nBut note: the loop for `hidden_proj` is over `i in [0, hidden_size)`. The load for `h_i` is a single element, so we don't need a vector. But the load for `col_i` is a vector of length `3*hidden_size`. We must mask that load as well.\n\nWe can change:\n\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size) * hidden_size)\n\nto:\n\n  idx_col = tl.arange(0, block_input)\n  mask_col = idx_col < (3 * hidden_size)\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + idx_col * hidden_size, mask=mask_col, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the bias load.\n\nBut note: the pointer for the weight matrix: `weight_hh_ptr` is a 2D matrix of shape (3*hidden_size, hidden_size). The element at row `j` and column `i` is at `weight_hh_ptr + j * hidden_size + i`. But in the kernel, we are doing:\n  weight_hh_ptr + i + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size) * hidden_size\nThis is equivalent to: for each j in [0, 3*hidden_size), we are accessing element [j, i]. So we are loading the entire column `i`.\n\nWe can change the column load to use the block_input and mask.\n\nSimilarly, we must change the store at the end.\n\nGiven the complexity, we will rewrite the kernel as follows:\n\nWe will pass two new constants: `block_input` (next_power_of_2(3*hidden_size)) and `block_hidden` (next_power_of_2(hidden_size)).\n\nThen in the kernel:\n\n  pid = tl.program_id(0)\n  off_input = pid * 3 * hidden_size\n  idx_input = tl.arange(0, block_input)\n  mask_input = idx_input < (3 * hidden_size)\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\n  off_h = pid * hidden_size\n  idx_hidden = tl.arange(0, block_hidden)\n  mask_hidden = idx_hidden < hidden_size\n  h_prev = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, mask=mask_hidden, other=0.0)\n\n  hidden_proj = tl.zeros((block_input,), dtype=tl.float32)   # we allocate for the rounded size, but we only care up to 3*hidden_size\n  for i in range(0, hidden_size):\n      # Load h_i only if i is within hidden_size (it always is because of the loop bound)\n      h_i = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + i)   # no mask needed because i is in [0, hidden_size)\n      # Now load the column i of the weight matrix: it has 3*hidden_size elements\n      col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i * hidden_size + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n      # But wait: the weight matrix is stored in row-major? The above is incorrect.\n\nLet me clarify: the weight matrix is of shape (3*hidden_size, hidden_size). The element at (j, i) is at `weight_hh_ptr + j * stride + i`. In the kernel, we are assuming row-major? The stride for the rows is hidden_size? Actually, we are passing the weight matrix as a 1D pointer. We must know the layout.\n\nIn the original code, the weight matrix is passed as `weight_hh` which is a 2D tensor of shape (3*hidden_size, hidden_size). In Triton, the pointer is to the first element, and we must use the stride. But the kernel does not take the stride of the weight matrix. This is a bug.\n\nWe must pass the stride of the weight matrix. Alternatively, we can assume it is row-major with stride `hidden_size` for the rows? That is, the element (j, i) is at `j * hidden_size + i`.\n\nBut note: in the original code, we are doing:\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size) * hidden_size)\n\nThis is equivalent to: for each row j, we are accessing `i + j * hidden_size`, which is the element (j, i). So we are loading the entire column i.\n\nBut the index is: `i` (the column index) plus `j * hidden_size` (the row index times the row stride). This assumes row-major with row stride = hidden_size.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nBut now we want to load a column with masking for the rows beyond `3*hidden_size`. We don't have rows beyond because the matrix has exactly `3*hidden_size` rows. So we don't need to mask by row count? But we are rounding to the next power of two for the vector length. So we must mask.\n\nSo the corrected load for the column is:\n\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + idx_input * hidden_size, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the bias.\n\nBut note: the bias is a vector of length `3*hidden_size`. We load it as:\n\n  bias = tl.load(bias_hh_ptr + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\nAfter the hidden_proj computation, we have a vector of length `block_input` but we only care about the first `3*hidden_size` elements.\n\nThen when computing the gates, we use slices of `hidden_proj` up to `3*hidden_size`. But note: we computed `hidden_proj` for the entire rounded vector? Actually, we did:\n\n  hidden_proj += col_i * h_i\n\nBut `col_i` is a vector of length `block_input` (with zeros beyond `3*hidden_size`). So `hidden_proj` is also of length `block_input`. We only care about the first `3*hidden_size` elements.\n\nThen when we do:\n\n  r_gate = tl.sigmoid(input_proj[:hidden_size] + hidden_proj[:hidden_size])\n\nWe are taking the first `hidden_size` elements of `hidden_proj`. But note: `hidden_proj` is of length `block_input`, which is at least `3*hidden_size`. So the slice `hidden_proj[:hidden_size]` is valid.\n\nBut we must note that `input_proj` and `hidden_proj` are of length `block_input` but we only care about the first `3*hidden_size` elements.\n\nThis should be safe.\n\nFinally, the store at the end:\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + tl.arange(0, hidden_size), new_h)\n\nWe must change this to:\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, new_h, mask=mask_hidden)\n\nBut note: `new_h` is computed from slices of vectors that are of length `hidden_size` (the real hidden_size). So it is a vector of length `hidden_size`. We are storing it to a contiguous block of `hidden_size` elements. We must store with the mask for `block_hidden`.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, new_h, mask=mask_hidden)\n\nBut note: `new_h` is computed as a vector of the real hidden_size. We are storing it to a location of size `block_hidden`? Actually, we are storing to `idx_hidden` which has `block_hidden` elements. We must have computed `new_h` for the real hidden_size and then zero-padded to `block_hidden`? No, we computed `new_h` for the real hidden_size. We only have `hidden_size` elements. We must compute `new_h` for the entire `block_hidden`? No, we only want the first `hidden_size` elements.\n\nActually, we computed `new_h` using the real hidden_size. So we have a vector of `hidden_size` elements. We are storing it to the memory location starting at `off_h` for `hidden_size` elements. We use the mask for the first `hidden_size` elements.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  new_h_padded = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n  new_h_padded = new_h_padded.to(tl.float32)   # ensure type\n  # Now put the new_h into the first `hidden_size` elements of new_h_padded\n  new_h_padded = tl.where(mask_hidden, new_h, new_h_padded)\n\nBut that would be inefficient. Alternatively, we can compute `new_h` as a vector of `block_hidden` elements, but then we would have to pad the input vectors to `block_hidden`? That complicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the kernel to only compute the `hidden_size` elements and then store with a mask. We don't need to pad `new_h` because we computed it for the real `hidden_size`. We can store the `new_h` vector to the memory location with a mask for the first `hidden_size` elements? But note: `new_h` is of length `hidden_size`. We are storing to a memory location that is contiguous and of length `hidden_size`? Then we don't need to mask? But the store is done with a vector of length `block_hidden`? We are currently storing with a vector of length `hidden_size`? No, we are using `tl.arange(0, hidden_size)`. But that is not allowed because it must be a power of two.\n\nSo we change the store to use the rounded vector:\n\n  idx_store = tl.arange(0, block_hidden)\n  mask_store = idx_store < hidden_size\n  # We have computed new_h for the real hidden_size? But we don't have a vector of length block_hidden.\n\nWe must recompute the kernel to output a vector of length block_hidden? Or we can do:\n\n  new_h_vector = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n  # Then set the first hidden_size elements to new_h\n  # But new_h is a scalar? No, it is a vector of length hidden_size? Actually, no: the operations are done element-wise? How did we compute new_h?\n\nLet me see:\n\n  r_gate = tl.sigmoid(input_proj[:hidden_size] + hidden_proj[:hidden_size])\n  z_gate = ... similar\n  n_input = ... \n  n = libdevice.tanhf(n_input)   # this is a vector of length hidden_size\n  new_h = (1 - z_gate) * n + z_gate * h_prev   # h_prev is of length block_hidden? But we only loaded the first hidden_size elements and the rest are zero.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nGiven the complexity, I propose an alternative: we remove the vector loads and stores and do everything element-wise in a loop. But that would be slow.\n\nAlternatively, we can block the kernel by having each program handle one element of the hidden state? Then we wouldn't have the vector load issue.\n\nBut that would change the kernel structure.\n\nGiven the time, we try to fix the current kernel with masking and next power of two.\n\nWe will:\n\n1. Remove the autotuner.\n2. Precompute on the host:\n   block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n   block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\n3. Pass these as constants to the kernel.\n4. In the kernel, use these for the vector loads and stores with masks.\n\nWe will change the kernel to:\n\n   @triton.jit\n   def gru_step_kernel(\n        ...,\n        hidden_size: tl.constexpr,\n        has_bias: tl.constexpr,\n        block_input: tl.constexpr,   # next power of two for 3*hidden_size\n        block_hidden: tl.constexpr,   # next power of two for hidden_size\n   ):\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        off_input = pid * 3 * hidden_size\n        idx_input = tl.arange(0, block_input)\n        mask_input = idx_input < (3 * hidden_size)\n        input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\n        off_h = pid * hidden_size\n        idx_hidden = tl.arange(0, block_hidden)\n        mask_hidden = idx_hidden < hidden_size\n        h_prev = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, mask=mask_hidden, other=0.0)\n\n        # hidden_proj: vector of length 3*hidden_size (but we use block_input for storage)\n        hidden_proj = tl.zeros((block_input,), dtype=tl.float32)\n        # We need to loop over the columns of the weight matrix (over hidden_size)\n        for i in range(hidden_size):\n            # Load the i-th element of the hidden state (scalar)\n            # Note: we already have h_prev loaded as a vector of length block_hidden, but only the first hidden_size are valid.\n            # But we can load from the vector we already have? Or load again? Let's load from the vector we have.\n            # We have h_prev[i] if i < hidden_size, else 0. But i is in [0, hidden_size) so we can use:\n            h_i = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + i)   # or use h_prev[i] but h_prev is of length block_hidden, not hidden_size.\n            # Actually, we have the vector h_prev in registers. We can do:\n            #   h_i = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + i)   # this is safe because i < hidden_size\n            # But we want to avoid the load. Alternatively, we can have loaded h_prev in a vector and then use:\n            #   h_i = h_prev[i]   # but only if i < block_hidden? We have mask_hidden for i? But i is < hidden_size <= block_hidden, so it's safe.\n            # So:\n            h_i = h_prev[i]   # This is not allowed because h_prev is a vector and we are in a scalar context?

The output tensor is of size (batch_size, hidden_size). We are storing to one batch element: from off_h to off_h + hidden_size - 1.\n        # We only want to store hidden_size elements.\n        # We can do:\n        #   output_vector = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n        #   output_vector = output_vector.to(tl.float32)\n        #   # Set the first hidden_size elements to new_h\n        #   output_vector = tl.where(tl.arange(0, block_hidden) < hidden_size, new_h[tl.arange(0, block_hidden)], output_vector)\n        # But this is complex and new_h is only defined for the first hidden_size.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can store with a mask:\n        tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, new_h, mask=mask_hidden)\n\nBut wait, `new_h` is a vector of length `hidden_size`, and `idx_hidden` is of length `block_hidden`. We cannot directly store a vector of length `hidden_size` into a location expecting `block_hidden` elements.\n\nWe must have `new_h` as a vector of length `block_hidden`? We can pad it with zeros.\n\n  new_h_padded = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n  # Create a mask for the indices in [0, hidden_size)\n  mask_store = tl.arange(0, block_hidden) < hidden_size\n  # new_h_padded[mask_store] = new_h\n  new_h_padded = tl.where(mask_store, new_h, new_h_padded)\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + tl.arange(0, block_hidden), new_h_padded)\n\nBut note: the output tensor is only of size `batch_size * hidden_size`. We are storing up to `block_hidden` elements per batch, but the output tensor has only `hidden_size` elements per batch. The extra elements might be out of bounds.\n\nSo we must not store beyond `hidden_size`.\n\nAlternatively, we can store only the first `hidden_size` elements by doing:\n\n  for i in range(hidden_size):\n      tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + i, new_h[i])\n\nBut that would be scalar and slow.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think we should change the kernel to have one program per hidden state element. That would be more natural and avoid the vector loads.\n\nHowever, that would be a major rewrite and might be slow.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I will provide a solution that removes the autotuner and uses the next_power_of_two for the vector loads and stores, with masking. We will also remove the explicit passing of `BLOCK_HS`.\n\nWe will not use the autotuner.\n\nLet's summarize the changes to the current program:\n\n1. Remove the autotuner decorator.\n2. In the forward pass, compute:\n   block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n   block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\n3. Change the kernel signature to include `block_input` and `block_hidden` as constants.\n4. Rewrite the kernel to use these block sizes for the vector loads and stores, with masking.\n5. In the kernel, when storing the result, we have `new_h` as a vector of length `hidden_size`. We will store it by:\n   - Creating a padded vector of length", "language": "python", "parent_id": "70e104fb-df3b-4c59-b89f-c577873068a3", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1754598611.8254607, "iteration_found": 25, "metrics": {"compiled": false, "correctness": false, "score": -100.0, "stage": "no_valid_triton_code", "feedback": "You need to generate real and valid triton code for the core function.

rewritten program maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```\n", "responses": ["<think>\nWe are given a program that uses Triton for a GRU step kernel. The current program fails with a correctness error and has a score of 10.0000 (which is the base score for compilation but failing correctness). The error in the verify_payload is a ValueError: \"Conflicting meta-parameters: BLOCK_HS. Make sure that you don't re-define auto-tuned symbols.\"\n\nLooking at the kernel, we see that the `gru_step_kernel` is autotuned with the key `hidden_size` and uses a parameter `BLOCK_HS`. However, in the forward pass, we are passing `BLOCK_HS=triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)`. The autotuner expects to tune `BLOCK_HS` but we are passing it as an argument. This causes a conflict because the autotuner will try to set `BLOCK_HS` as a tuning parameter, but we are also passing it as an explicit argument.\n\nThe solution is to remove the explicit passing of `BLOCK_HS` in the kernel call. The autotuner will handle setting the value of `BLOCK_HS` based on the configurations and the key.\n\nAdditionally, we must note that the kernel uses `tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size)` and `tl.arange(0, hidden_size)`. The problem is that the range must be a power of two. We can fix this by rounding up the range to the next power of two and then using a mask.\n\nHowever, the error we are currently facing is about conflicting meta-parameters. Therefore, let's first remove the explicit `BLOCK_HS` argument from the kernel call.\n\nWe also note that the kernel uses `libdevice.tanhf` for the tanh activation. This is acceptable, but we must make sure that the Triton kernel is correctly handling the data.\n\nAnother issue: the kernel does not have any masking for the loads. The hidden size might not be a power of two, so we must mask the operations that involve vectors of length `3 * hidden_size` and `hidden_size`. We see that the kernel loads for `input_proj` and `h_prev` are done without masks. Similarly, the loop for `hidden_proj` does not mask the loads for `col_i` and `bias` (if present). We must add masks to avoid out-of-bounds accesses.\n\nLet's break down the required changes:\n\n1. Remove the explicit `BLOCK_HS` argument from the kernel call in the forward pass.\n2. In the kernel, we must use masks for all loads and stores that depend on the hidden size, because the actual hidden size might not be a power of two. We are currently using `tl.arange(0, ...)` without masking against the hidden size.\n\nHowever, note that the kernel is defined with a `BLOCK_HS` that is a `tl.constexpr`. We are using it in the autotuner, but we are not using it in the kernel to block the computation. We are using loops over `hidden_size` without blocking. This might be inefficient.\n\nGiven the time, we focus on correctness and compilation.\n\nProposed changes:\n\nIn the kernel:\n- For the loads of `input_proj` and `h_prev`, we are loading vectors of length `3 * hidden_size` and `hidden_size` respectively. We must mask these loads because the actual hidden size might not be a multiple of the block size. However, note that we are rounding the range to the next power of two? Actually, we are not. We are using `tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size)`. This will fail if `3 * hidden_size` is not a power of two.\n\nWe have two options:\n  a) Change the kernel to use a block size that is the next power of two and then mask.\n  b) Change the way we launch the kernel so that we only use power-of-two sizes for the vectors.\n\nBut note the error: \"arange's range must be a power of 2\". So we must ensure that the range in `tl.arange` is a power of two.\n\nWe can do:\n  Let `BLOCK = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * hidden_size)` and then mask with `mask = tl.arange(0, BLOCK) < 3 * hidden_size`.\n\nBut wait, the kernel is already taking `BLOCK_HS` as a tuning parameter. We can use `BLOCK_HS` for the next power of two of the hidden size? Actually, the autotuner key is `hidden_size` and we are passing `BLOCK_HS` as a config. We are not using `BLOCK_HS` in the kernel for the arange. We are using `hidden_size` directly.\n\nWe must restructure the kernel:\n\nInstead of:\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size))\n\nWe can do:\n  BLOCK_INPUT = 3 * hidden_size\n  BLOCK_INPUT_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(BLOCK_INPUT)\n  idx = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_INPUT_POW2)\n  mask = idx < BLOCK_INPUT\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the hidden state.\n\nBut note: the autotuner is tuning `BLOCK_HS` but we are not using it in the kernel for the vector length. We are using it as a block size for the hidden size? Actually, we are not using it at all in the kernel body. This is a mistake.\n\nWe have two choices:\n  1. Redesign the kernel to use `BLOCK_HS` as the block size for the hidden dimension and then loop over blocks.\n  2. Remove the autotuner and instead compute the next power of two for the vector lengths and use masking.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the kernel is currently written for a single program per hidden state element? Actually, no: each program is processing an entire hidden state vector for one batch.\n\nThe kernel is launched with `grid = (batch_size,)`. Each program handles one batch element. It loads the entire input projection (3*hidden_size) and the entire previous hidden state (hidden_size). Then it does a loop over the hidden_size to compute the hidden_proj.\n\nThis is inefficient because the loop over hidden_size is sequential. But we are in a kernel that is already per batch element.\n\nTo fix the power-of-two issue, we must change the loads to use a rounded-up size and mask.\n\nWe are going to do:\n\n  BLOCK_INPUT = 3 * hidden_size\n  BLOCK_INPUT_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(BLOCK_INPUT)\n  idx_input = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_INPUT_POW2)\n  mask_input = idx_input < BLOCK_INPUT\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the hidden state:\n\n  BLOCK_HIDDEN = hidden_size\n  BLOCK_HIDDEN_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(BLOCK_HIDDEN)\n  idx_hidden = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_HIDDEN_POW2)\n  mask_hidden = idx_hidden < BLOCK_HIDDEN\n  h_prev = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, mask=mask_hidden, other=0.0)\n\nBut note: the hidden_proj computation loops over `i in range(0, hidden_size)`. This is scalar and we cannot change that easily. However, the load for `h_i` is just one element, so it doesn't require a vector. The load for `col_i` is a vector of length 3*hidden_size. We must do the same masking for that vector.\n\nWe can change the loop to use a block of columns? But that would complicate. Alternatively, we can make sure that the hidden_size is a power of two? But we cannot assume that.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the kernel to not use vector loads for the entire input_proj and h_prev. Instead, we can loop over the hidden_size in blocks and use vector loads for blocks. But that would be a major rewrite.\n\nGiven the time, we focus on fixing the immediate errors:\n\n1. Remove the explicit `BLOCK_HS` from the kernel call to avoid the autotune conflict.\n2. Change the vector loads to use the next power of two and masks to avoid the non-power-of-two error.\n\nWe will remove the autotuner for now because the kernel is not using the `BLOCK_HS` in the body. We can reintroduce autotuning later if we block the computation.\n\nBut note: the kernel is currently autotuned with `BLOCK_HS` and the key `hidden_size`. We are not using `BLOCK_HS` in the kernel. This is a mistake. We can remove the autotuner for now to make progress.\n\nAlternatively, we can use `BLOCK_HS` as the next power of two for the hidden_size and then use it in the masking. Let's try that.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  Let BLOCK_HS be the next power of two of the hidden_size. Then in the kernel, we use:\n      input_size_total = 3 * hidden_size\n      input_block = triton.next_power_of_2(input_size_total)\n      ... and similarly for the hidden vector.\n\nBut we are passing `BLOCK_HS` as a configuration parameter. We can instead compute it as the next power of two of the hidden_size and then use it for the vector length.\n\nHowever, the autotuner is setting `BLOCK_HS` to values like 128, 256, etc. We cannot use those as the next power of two for the hidden_size because the hidden_size is fixed. So we must remove the autotuner.\n\nGiven the complexity, I propose to remove the autotuner and instead compute the required next power of two inside the kernel for the vector lengths. But note: the next_power_of_2 function is not available in the kernel. So we must pass it as a constant.\n\nWe can pass the next power of two for the hidden_size and for 3*hidden_size as kernel arguments. But note the kernel already has `hidden_size` as a constant. We can compute the next power of two for the vectors:\n\n  BLOCK_INPUT_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * hidden_size)\n  BLOCK_HIDDEN_POW2 = triton.next_power_of_2(hidden_size)\n\nThen in the kernel, we use these for the arange and mask.\n\nBut we cannot compute `triton.next_power_of_2` inside the kernel? We can precompute it on the host and pass it as a constant.\n\nSo in the forward pass, we compute:\n  block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n  block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\n\nAnd then pass these as new constants to the kernel.\n\nBut the kernel is already taking `hidden_size` and `has_bias`. We can add two new constants: `block_input` and `block_hidden`.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute these in the kernel? The `hidden_size` is a constant, so we can do:\n  block_input = 1 << (tl.math.ceil(tl.math.log2(3 * hidden_size)))\nBut Triton doesn't have a log2 function? Actually, we can use `tl.math.log2` and `tl.math.ceil`.\n\nHowever, it's easier to compute on the host and pass as constants.\n\nLet's restructure:\n\nWe remove the autotuner and then pass two new constants: `block_input` and `block_hidden` which are the next power of two for the input projection vector and hidden state vector.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid autotuning and just remove the autotune decorator.\n\nGiven the above, here is the plan:\n\nStep 1: Remove the autotuner decorator.\nStep 2: In the forward pass, compute:\n        block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n        block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\nStep 3: Pass these two as new arguments to the kernel.\nStep 4: In the kernel, use these block sizes for the arange and mask for the vector loads.\n\nAdditionally, we must mask the other loads in the loop for `col_i` and `bias`.\n\nBut note: the loop for `hidden_proj` is over `i in [0, hidden_size)`. The load for `h_i` is a single element, so we don't need a vector. But the load for `col_i` is a vector of length `3*hidden_size`. We must mask that load as well.\n\nWe can change:\n\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size) * hidden_size)\n\nto:\n\n  idx_col = tl.arange(0, block_input)\n  mask_col = idx_col < (3 * hidden_size)\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + idx_col * hidden_size, mask=mask_col, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the bias load.\n\nBut note: the pointer for the weight matrix: `weight_hh_ptr` is a 2D matrix of shape (3*hidden_size, hidden_size). The element at row `j` and column `i` is at `weight_hh_ptr + j * hidden_size + i`. But in the kernel, we are doing:\n  weight_hh_ptr + i + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size) * hidden_size\nThis is equivalent to: for each j in [0, 3*hidden_size), we are accessing element [j, i]. So we are loading the entire column `i`.\n\nWe can change the column load to use the block_input and mask.\n\nSimilarly, we must change the store at the end.\n\nGiven the complexity, we will rewrite the kernel as follows:\n\nWe will pass two new constants: `block_input` (next_power_of_2(3*hidden_size)) and `block_hidden` (next_power_of_2(hidden_size)).\n\nThen in the kernel:\n\n  pid = tl.program_id(0)\n  off_input = pid * 3 * hidden_size\n  idx_input = tl.arange(0, block_input)\n  mask_input = idx_input < (3 * hidden_size)\n  input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\n  off_h = pid * hidden_size\n  idx_hidden = tl.arange(0, block_hidden)\n  mask_hidden = idx_hidden < hidden_size\n  h_prev = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, mask=mask_hidden, other=0.0)\n\n  hidden_proj = tl.zeros((block_input,), dtype=tl.float32)   # we allocate for the rounded size, but we only care up to 3*hidden_size\n  for i in range(0, hidden_size):\n      # Load h_i only if i is within hidden_size (it always is because of the loop bound)\n      h_i = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + i)   # no mask needed because i is in [0, hidden_size)\n      # Now load the column i of the weight matrix: it has 3*hidden_size elements\n      col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i * hidden_size + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n      # But wait: the weight matrix is stored in row-major? The above is incorrect.\n\nLet me clarify: the weight matrix is of shape (3*hidden_size, hidden_size). The element at (j, i) is at `weight_hh_ptr + j * stride + i`. In the kernel, we are assuming row-major? The stride for the rows is hidden_size? Actually, we are passing the weight matrix as a 1D pointer. We must know the layout.\n\nIn the original code, the weight matrix is passed as `weight_hh` which is a 2D tensor of shape (3*hidden_size, hidden_size). In Triton, the pointer is to the first element, and we must use the stride. But the kernel does not take the stride of the weight matrix. This is a bug.\n\nWe must pass the stride of the weight matrix. Alternatively, we can assume it is row-major with stride `hidden_size` for the rows? That is, the element (j, i) is at `j * hidden_size + i`.\n\nBut note: in the original code, we are doing:\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + tl.arange(0, 3 * hidden_size) * hidden_size)\n\nThis is equivalent to: for each row j, we are accessing `i + j * hidden_size`, which is the element (j, i). So we are loading the entire column i.\n\nBut the index is: `i` (the column index) plus `j * hidden_size` (the row index times the row stride). This assumes row-major with row stride = hidden_size.\n\nSo the formula is correct.\n\nBut now we want to load a column with masking for the rows beyond `3*hidden_size`. We don't have rows beyond because the matrix has exactly `3*hidden_size` rows. So we don't need to mask by row count? But we are rounding to the next power of two for the vector length. So we must mask.\n\nSo the corrected load for the column is:\n\n  col_i = tl.load(weight_hh_ptr + i + idx_input * hidden_size, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\nSimilarly for the bias.\n\nBut note: the bias is a vector of length `3*hidden_size`. We load it as:\n\n  bias = tl.load(bias_hh_ptr + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\nAfter the hidden_proj computation, we have a vector of length `block_input` but we only care about the first `3*hidden_size` elements.\n\nThen when computing the gates, we use slices of `hidden_proj` up to `3*hidden_size`. But note: we computed `hidden_proj` for the entire rounded vector? Actually, we did:\n\n  hidden_proj += col_i * h_i\n\nBut `col_i` is a vector of length `block_input` (with zeros beyond `3*hidden_size`). So `hidden_proj` is also of length `block_input`. We only care about the first `3*hidden_size` elements.\n\nThen when we do:\n\n  r_gate = tl.sigmoid(input_proj[:hidden_size] + hidden_proj[:hidden_size])\n\nWe are taking the first `hidden_size` elements of `hidden_proj`. But note: `hidden_proj` is of length `block_input`, which is at least `3*hidden_size`. So the slice `hidden_proj[:hidden_size]` is valid.\n\nBut we must note that `input_proj` and `hidden_proj` are of length `block_input` but we only care about the first `3*hidden_size` elements.\n\nThis should be safe.\n\nFinally, the store at the end:\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + tl.arange(0, hidden_size), new_h)\n\nWe must change this to:\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, new_h, mask=mask_hidden)\n\nBut note: `new_h` is computed from slices of vectors that are of length `hidden_size` (the real hidden_size). So it is a vector of length `hidden_size`. We are storing it to a contiguous block of `hidden_size` elements. We must store with the mask for `block_hidden`.\n\nSo we do:\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, new_h, mask=mask_hidden)\n\nBut note: `new_h` is computed as a vector of the real hidden_size. We are storing it to a location of size `block_hidden`? Actually, we are storing to `idx_hidden` which has `block_hidden` elements. We must have computed `new_h` for the real hidden_size and then zero-padded to `block_hidden`? No, we computed `new_h` for the real hidden_size. We only have `hidden_size` elements. We must compute `new_h` for the entire `block_hidden`? No, we only want the first `hidden_size` elements.\n\nActually, we computed `new_h` using the real hidden_size. So we have a vector of `hidden_size` elements. We are storing it to the memory location starting at `off_h` for `hidden_size` elements. We use the mask for the first `hidden_size` elements.\n\nWe can do:\n\n  new_h_padded = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n  new_h_padded = new_h_padded.to(tl.float32)   # ensure type\n  # Now put the new_h into the first `hidden_size` elements of new_h_padded\n  new_h_padded = tl.where(mask_hidden, new_h, new_h_padded)\n\nBut that would be inefficient. Alternatively, we can compute `new_h` as a vector of `block_hidden` elements, but then we would have to pad the input vectors to `block_hidden`? That complicates.\n\nAlternatively, we can change the kernel to only compute the `hidden_size` elements and then store with a mask. We don't need to pad `new_h` because we computed it for the real `hidden_size`. We can store the `new_h` vector to the memory location with a mask for the first `hidden_size` elements? But note: `new_h` is of length `hidden_size`. We are storing to a memory location that is contiguous and of length `hidden_size`? Then we don't need to mask? But the store is done with a vector of length `block_hidden`? We are currently storing with a vector of length `hidden_size`? No, we are using `tl.arange(0, hidden_size)`. But that is not allowed because it must be a power of two.\n\nSo we change the store to use the rounded vector:\n\n  idx_store = tl.arange(0, block_hidden)\n  mask_store = idx_store < hidden_size\n  # We have computed new_h for the real hidden_size? But we don't have a vector of length block_hidden.\n\nWe must recompute the kernel to output a vector of length block_hidden? Or we can do:\n\n  new_h_vector = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n  # Then set the first hidden_size elements to new_h\n  # But new_h is a scalar? No, it is a vector of length hidden_size? Actually, no: the operations are done element-wise? How did we compute new_h?\n\nLet me see:\n\n  r_gate = tl.sigmoid(input_proj[:hidden_size] + hidden_proj[:hidden_size])\n  z_gate = ... similar\n  n_input = ... \n  n = libdevice.tanhf(n_input)   # this is a vector of length hidden_size\n  new_h = (1 - z_gate) * n + z_gate * h_prev   # h_prev is of length block_hidden? But we only loaded the first hidden_size elements and the rest are zero.\n\nThis is messy.\n\nGiven the complexity, I propose an alternative: we remove the vector loads and stores and do everything element-wise in a loop. But that would be slow.\n\nAlternatively, we can block the kernel by having each program handle one element of the hidden state? Then we wouldn't have the vector load issue.\n\nBut that would change the kernel structure.\n\nGiven the time, we try to fix the current kernel with masking and next power of two.\n\nWe will:\n\n1. Remove the autotuner.\n2. Precompute on the host:\n   block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n   block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\n3. Pass these as constants to the kernel.\n4. In the kernel, use these for the vector loads and stores with masks.\n\nWe will change the kernel to:\n\n   @triton.jit\n   def gru_step_kernel(\n        ...,\n        hidden_size: tl.constexpr,\n        has_bias: tl.constexpr,\n        block_input: tl.constexpr,   # next power of two for 3*hidden_size\n        block_hidden: tl.constexpr,   # next power of two for hidden_size\n   ):\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        off_input = pid * 3 * hidden_size\n        idx_input = tl.arange(0, block_input)\n        mask_input = idx_input < (3 * hidden_size)\n        input_proj = tl.load(input_proj_ptr + off_input + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\n        off_h = pid * hidden_size\n        idx_hidden = tl.arange(0, block_hidden)\n        mask_hidden = idx_hidden < hidden_size\n        h_prev = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, mask=mask_hidden, other=0.0)\n\n        # hidden_proj: vector of length 3*hidden_size (but we use block_input for storage)\n        hidden_proj = tl.zeros((block_input,), dtype=tl.float32)\n        # We need to loop over the columns of the weight matrix (over hidden_size)\n        for i in range(hidden_size):\n            # Load the i-th element of the hidden state (scalar)\n            # Note: we already have h_prev loaded as a vector of length block_hidden, but only the first hidden_size are valid.\n            # But we can load from the vector we already have? Or load again? Let's load from the vector we have.\n            # We have h_prev[i] if i < hidden_size, else 0. But i is in [0, hidden_size) so we can use:\n            h_i = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + i)   # or use h_prev[i] but h_prev is of length block_hidden, not hidden_size.\n            # Actually, we have the vector h_prev in registers. We can do:\n            #   h_i = tl.load(h_prev_ptr + off_h + i)   # this is safe because i < hidden_size\n            # But we want to avoid the load. Alternatively, we can have loaded h_prev in a vector and then use:\n            #   h_i = h_prev[i]   # but only if i < block_hidden? We have mask_hidden for i? But i is < hidden_size <= block_hidden, so it's safe.\n            # So:\n            h_i = h_prev[i]   # This is not allowed because h_prev is a vector and we are in a scalar context? Actually, we can index.\n\n            # Load the column i of weight_hh: it is a vector of length 3*hidden_size\n            # The weight matrix: weight_hh_ptr points to the matrix of size (3*hidden_size, hidden_size), row-major, stride=hidden_size.\n            col_ptr = weight_hh_ptr + i   # start of column i: then each row j is at col_ptr + j * hidden_size\n            col_i = tl.load(col_ptr + idx_input * hidden_size, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n\n            hidden_proj += col_i * h_i\n\n        if has_bias:\n            bias = tl.load(bias_hh_ptr + idx_input, mask=mask_input, other=0.0)\n            hidden_proj += bias\n\n        # Now, the gates: we only care about the first 3*hidden_size of hidden_proj, and we know input_proj is of length 3*hidden_size (with zeros beyond)\n        r_gate = tl.sigmoid(input_proj[0:hidden_size] + hidden_proj[0:hidden_size])\n        z_gate = tl.sigmoid(input_proj[hidden_size:2*hidden_size] + hidden_proj[hidden_size:2*hidden_size])\n        n_input = input_proj[2*hidden_size:3*hidden_size] + r_gate * hidden_proj[2*hidden_size:3*hidden_size]\n        n = libdevice.tanhf(n_input)\n        new_h = (1 - z_gate) * n + z_gate * h_prev[0:hidden_size]   # note: we only care about the first hidden_size elements of h_prev\n\n        # Store new_h: it is a vector of length hidden_size\n        # We store it to the memory location, but using a vector of length block_hidden with masking.\n        # We need to create a vector of length block_hidden, with the first hidden_size elements being new_h and the rest zero.\n        # But note: the memory after hidden_size might be out-of-bound of the output tensor? The output tensor is of size (batch_size, hidden_size). We are storing to one batch element: from off_h to off_h + hidden_size - 1.\n        # We only want to store hidden_size elements.\n        # We can do:\n        #   output_vector = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n        #   output_vector = output_vector.to(tl.float32)\n        #   # Set the first hidden_size elements to new_h\n        #   output_vector = tl.where(tl.arange(0, block_hidden) < hidden_size, new_h[tl.arange(0, block_hidden)], output_vector)\n        # But this is complex and new_h is only defined for the first hidden_size.\n\n        # Alternatively, we can store with a mask:\n        tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + idx_hidden, new_h, mask=mask_hidden)\n\nBut wait, `new_h` is a vector of length `hidden_size`, and `idx_hidden` is of length `block_hidden`. We cannot directly store a vector of length `hidden_size` into a location expecting `block_hidden` elements.\n\nWe must have `new_h` as a vector of length `block_hidden`? We can pad it with zeros.\n\n  new_h_padded = tl.zeros((block_hidden,), dtype=tl.float32)\n  # Create a mask for the indices in [0, hidden_size)\n  mask_store = tl.arange(0, block_hidden) < hidden_size\n  # new_h_padded[mask_store] = new_h\n  new_h_padded = tl.where(mask_store, new_h, new_h_padded)\n\n  tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + tl.arange(0, block_hidden), new_h_padded)\n\nBut note: the output tensor is only of size `batch_size * hidden_size`. We are storing up to `block_hidden` elements per batch, but the output tensor has only `hidden_size` elements per batch. The extra elements might be out of bounds.\n\nSo we must not store beyond `hidden_size`.\n\nAlternatively, we can store only the first `hidden_size` elements by doing:\n\n  for i in range(hidden_size):\n      tl.store(output_ptr + off_h + i, new_h[i])\n\nBut that would be scalar and slow.\n\nGiven the complexity, I think we should change the kernel to have one program per hidden state element. That would be more natural and avoid the vector loads.\n\nHowever, that would be a major rewrite and might be slow.\n\nGiven the time constraints, I will provide a solution that removes the autotuner and uses the next_power_of_two for the vector loads and stores, with masking. We will also remove the explicit passing of `BLOCK_HS`.\n\nWe will not use the autotuner.\n\nLet's summarize the changes to the current program:\n\n1. Remove the autotuner decorator.\n2. In the forward pass, compute:\n   block_input = triton.next_power_of_2(3 * self.hidden_size)\n   block_hidden = triton.next_power_of_2(self.hidden_size)\n3. Change the kernel signature to include `block_input` and `block_hidden` as constants.\n4. Rewrite the kernel to use these block sizes for the vector loads and stores, with masking.\n5. In the kernel, when storing the result, we have `new_h` as a vector of length `hidden_size`. We will store it by:\n   - Creating a padded vector of length"]}}}

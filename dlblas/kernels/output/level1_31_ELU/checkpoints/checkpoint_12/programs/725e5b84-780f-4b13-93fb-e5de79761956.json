The current implementation uses `F.elu` from PyTorch. However, the goal is to rewrite it using Triton for better performance.\n\nWe note that the current implementation already has a speedup of 1.519 (from the meta information) over the reference, but that reference is likely a naive implementation. The current program is the reference code (stage: reference code) and we are to rewrite it in Triton.\n\nThe task is to write a Triton kernel for the ELU activation function and replace the forward method of the ModelNew class to use this kernel.\n\nELU function is defined as:\n  elu(x) = x if x > 0\n          = alpha * (exp(x) - 1) if x <= 0\n\nWe can write a Triton kernel that applies this element-wise operation. Since it's element-wise, we can process each element independently.\n\nSteps:\n1. We will write a Triton kernel that takes the input tensor, the alpha value, and the output tensor.\n2. The kernel will use a grid that has as many programs as there are elements in the input, but we will group elements into blocks for efficiency.\n3. We will use a 1D kernel because the operation is element-wise and the input can be of any shape. We will flatten the input and then unflatten the output.\n\nHowever, note that the input tensor in the example is of shape (batch_size, dim) = (16, 16384). We can process all elements.\n\nWe must be cautious of the data types. The input is float32 (from torch.randn) and the output should be float32.\n\nWe'll design the kernel:\n\n  @triton.jit\n  def elu_kernel(\n      x_ptr,\n      out_ptr,\n      alpha,\n      n_elements,\n      BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n  ):\n      pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n      block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n      offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n      mask = offsets < n_elements\n\n      x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n      # Compute ELU\n      zero = 0.0\n      positive_part = tl.where(x > zero, x, zero)\n      negative_part = tl.where(x <= zero, alpha * (tl.exp(x) - 1.0), zero)\n      output = positive_part + negative_part\n\n      tl.store(out_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)\n\nIn the forward method of ModelNew, we will:\n  - Flatten the input tensor and create an output tensor of the same shape and dtype.\n  - Determine the grid and block size.\n  - Launch the kernel.\n\nWe note that the input tensor might be non-contiguous. We should make sure to work on contiguous data.\n\nWe also note that the kernel must handle any number of elements. We can set the grid to be the ceiling of (n_elements / BLOCK_SIZE).\n\nWe must choose a BLOCK_SIZE that is a power of two and appropriate for the hardware. We can use 1024 as a starting point.\n\nWe can also use autotuning to find the best BLOCK_SIZE and number of warps. However, the problem states to keep it simple and make small steps. We can start with a fixed BLOCK_SIZE and then later consider autotuning.\n\nBut note: The current program does not use Triton at all. We are introducing Triton.\n\nWe are to replace the forward method of ModelNew. We must keep the same interface.\n\nWe also note that the model has an alpha parameter. We will pass this to the kernel.\n\nWe must be cautious of the fact that the kernel must be compiled and that the device of the tensor must be the same.\n\nWe will write the kernel in the same file, but note that we are only allowed to change the code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\nWe will structure the code as:\n\n  import triton and tl\n\n  Define the kernel (inside the class? Not necessary. We can define it at the top level but within the EVOLVE-BLOCK)\n\n  Then in the forward method of ModelNew, we call the kernel.\n\nBut note: The EVOLVE-BLOCK must contain the entire program? Actually, the problem says to return the complete updated code containing the EVOLVE-BLOCK comment marker.\n\nWe are going to write:\n\n  class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n      ... same __init__ ...\n\n      def forward(...):\n          ... new implementation with triton ...\n\n  And then we also define the kernel in the same block.\n\nHowever, note that the original code also has batch_size and dim and the functions get_inputs and get_init_inputs. We must keep those.\n\nWe must be cautious: The kernel must be defined in the same scope as the class? Actually, we can define it outside the class but within the same module.\n\nBut note: The EVOLVE-BLOCK must be self-contained? We are only allowed to change the block.\n\nWe are going to put the kernel definition and the modified class inside the block.\n\nLet's write:\n\n  import triton\n  import triton.language as tl\n\n  @triton.jit\n  def elu_kernel(...):\n      ...\n\n  class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n      ... same __init__ ...\n\n      def forward(self, x):\n          # Flatten the tensor and then reshape back\n          shape = x.shape\n          x_flat = x.flatten().contiguous()\n          n_elements = x_flat.numel()\n          output_flat = torch.empty_like(x_flat)\n\n          # Define grid and block\n          BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n          grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n          elu_kernel[grid](x_flat, output_flat, self.alpha, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n          return output_flat.view(shape)\n\n  And then the rest: batch_size, dim, get_inputs, get_init_inputs.\n\nHowever, note that the kernel uses an extra argument (n_elements) and we pass self.alpha. Also, we must pass the alpha as a scalar.\n\nBut note: We are passing self.alpha which is a float. In the kernel, we can load it as a constant.\n\nWe must also note that the kernel must have the correct types. The kernel expects the alpha to be a float. We can pass it as a tl.constexpr? Or we can pass it as a scalar and then use it in the kernel.\n\nAlternatively, we can use tl.full to broadcast alpha to the same shape as the block? But that is inefficient. Instead, we can pass it as a scalar and let Triton handle it.\n\nWe can declare alpha as a scalar in the kernel by not giving it a shape. We do:\n\n  elu_kernel[grid](x_flat, output_flat, alpha, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\nIn the kernel, we define:\n\n  alpha: tl.constexpr,   # or without tl.constexpr? Actually, we can pass it as a scalar.\n\nBut note: The kernel arguments that are not tensors must be passed as constants? We can mark them as tl.constexpr if they are compile-time constants. However, alpha might change (though it is fixed for the model). We can pass it as a scalar and then use it without constexpr.\n\nAlternatively, we can pass it as a 0-dimensional tensor? But that complicates.\n\nWe can simply pass it as a scalar and use it in the kernel without any special annotation. Triton will treat it as a constant per kernel launch.\n\nLet's try without constexpr.\n\nWe must also note that the kernel must be compiled for each different alpha? Probably not, because the alpha is passed as an argument and the kernel is JIT compiled. But Triton might recompile for each different alpha? We don't want that. We can avoid by making alpha a tensor? Or we can accept recompilation for different alpha? Since the model is initialized with a fixed alpha, it's acceptable.\n\nAlternatively, we can pass alpha as a tensor with one element? Then we can load it once at the beginning. But that would be inefficient. Instead, we can pass it as a scalar and Triton will treat it as a constant.\n\nWe'll do:\n\n  kernel(..., alpha, ...)\n\n  In the kernel:\n      negative_part = tl.where(x <= 0, alpha * (tl.exp(x) - 1.0), 0.0)\n\nBut note: We are using `alpha` as a scalar. This is acceptable.\n\nWe also note that the kernel must handle the entire tensor. We are using a 1D grid.\n\nLet's write the kernel with BLOCK_SIZE as a tl.constexpr.\n\nWe must also note that the kernel must check boundaries. We are using a mask.\n\nNow, we must test the kernel in the forward method. We are replacing the F.elu with our kernel.\n\nWe must be cautious: The original F.elu has an in-place option? We are not using in-place. We are creating a new tensor.\n\nWe are creating output_flat and then returning a view of the original shape.\n\nWe must also note that the kernel must be launched on the same device as the input. The input is on CUDA.\n\nWe must import triton and tl. We are going to add the imports at the top.\n\nBut note: The original code does not import triton. We must add the import.\n\nWe are allowed to change the code within the block arbitrarily? Yes, as long as we don't change the function signatures of the class or the get_inputs and get_init_inputs? Actually, we are allowed to change the entire block.\n\nWe are going to:\n\n  import triton\n  import triton.language as tl\n\n  then define the kernel, then the class, then the batch_size, dim, get_inputs, get_init_inputs.\n\nBut note: The get_inputs function returns a list with one tensor. We are not changing that.\n\nWe are also not changing the get_init_inputs.\n\nWe must be cautious of the device. We are using the same device as the input.\n\nWe set BLOCK_SIZE to 1024. We can also try to autotune, but for simplicity we start with 1024.\n\nWe note that the current speedup is 1.519 (from the reference_timing_ms and custom_timing). But that was for the reference PyTorch implementation? Actually, the meta says:\n  reference_timing_ms: 0.0246, custom_timing: 0.0162, speed_up: 1.519\n\nBut that was for the reference code? Now we are replacing the reference code with Triton. We hope to get even more speedup.\n\nHowever, note that the reference code (F.elu) is already optimized by PyTorch. We must be cautious that our Triton kernel might not be faster. But we are targeting the GPU and we are writing a simple kernel.\n\nWe can also note that the operation is memory bound. We are reading and writing the same amount of data. Therefore, the main optimization is to have coalesced memory accesses. Our kernel with contiguous data and BLOCK_SIZE that is a multiple of the warp size should be efficient.\n\nWe choose BLOCK_SIZE=1024, which is a typical block size.\n\nLet's write the code accordingly.\n\nWe also note that we are using the same grid function as in the example.\n\nWe must compute the grid as the ceiling of n_elements / BLOCK_SIZE.\n\nWe write:\n\n  grid = (triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE),)\n\nBut note: We are using a lambda for grid? We can write:\n\n  grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n\nThen when we launch the kernel, we pass BLOCK_SIZE as a keyword argument? Actually, we are setting it as a constant (1024) in the kernel launch? But we are also passing it to the grid function? The grid function uses meta['BLOCK_SIZE'].\n\nWe can set the grid to:\n\n  grid = (triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE),)\n\nBut then we cannot change BLOCK_SIZE without changing the grid. Alternatively, we can use the lambda and then pass BLOCK_SIZE to the kernel as a named argument that the grid function uses.\n\nWe do:\n\n  elu_kernel[grid](x_flat, output_flat, self.alpha, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\nAnd the grid function uses meta['BLOCK_SIZE'].\n\nBut note: We are passing BLOCK_SIZE to the kernel as a constant. The grid function also uses the same BLOCK_SIZE. This is safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can avoid the lambda and compute the grid directly:\n\n  grid = ( (n_elements + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE, )\n\nBut the triton.cdiv is better.\n\nWe'll use:\n\n  grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']), )\n\nBut note: The kernel has a parameter named BLOCK_SIZE. We are passing it as a keyword argument. The grid function will use the same BLOCK_SIZE.\n\nWe are ready.\n\nWe write the entire block.\n\nImportant: We must not change the class name (ModelNew) and the functions get_inputs and get_init_inputs.\n\nWe must also note that the kernel must be compiled. We are using @triton.jit.\n\nWe are going to write the code accordingly.\n\nOne more note: The kernel uses tl.exp. This is supported.\n\nLet's write the code.\n</think>\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef elu_kernel(\n    x_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    alpha,\n    n_elements,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = offsets < n_elements\n    \n    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    zero = 0.0\n    positive_part = tl.where(x > zero, x, zero)\n    negative_part = tl.where(x <= zero, alpha * (tl.exp(x) - 1.0), zero)\n    output = positive_part + negative_part\n    \n    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, alpha: float = 1.0):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.alpha = alpha\n    \n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Flatten input for 1D kernel processing\n        shape = x.shape\n        x_flat = x.flatten().contiguous()\n        output_flat = torch.empty_like(x_flat)\n        n_elements = x_flat.numel()\n        \n        # Optimized kernel configuration\n        BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n        elu_kernel[grid](x_flat, output_flat, self.alpha, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n        \n        return output_flat.view(shape)\n\nbatch_size = 16\ndim = 16384\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    x = torch.randn(batch_size, dim, device='cuda')\n    return [x]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return [1.0]  # Provide alpha value for initialization\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

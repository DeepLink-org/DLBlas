The current implementation uses `F.elu` from PyTorch.\n However, the task is to rewrite it using Triton for better performance.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the current model uses a simple element-wise operation (ELU). \n 2. We can write a Triton kernel for the ELU activation function to potentially speed it up.\n\n ELU function:\n   elu(x) = x if x > 0, else alpha * (exp(x) - 1)\n\n 3. We will design a Triton kernel that processes the input tensor in blocks.\n\n Important: The Triton kernel must handle arbitrary shapes (so we use 1D grid) and must have boundary checks.\n\n 4. We note that the input tensor is of shape [batch_size, dim]. We can flatten it to 1D for simplicity? \n    But note: the original returns the same shape. We can process the entire tensor as a 1D array.\n\n 5. We'll create a kernel that:\n    - Takes the input pointer, output pointer, alpha, and the total number of elements.\n    - Uses program IDs along the 1D grid to process contiguous blocks.\n\n 6. We must be cautious about the exponential function. We can use `tl.exp` for the negative part.\n\n 7. We will also note that the current PyTorch implementation might already be optimized. However, we are to try to beat it.\n\n 8. We will use a typical block size (e.g., 1024) and then tune the grid accordingly.\n\n 9. We must not change the function signature of the forward method. We'll replace the internal with a call to our Triton kernel.\n\n 10. We note that the module has an `alpha` parameter. We will pass that to the kernel.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We write a Triton kernel for the ELU operation:\n\n   ```\n   @triton.jit\n   def elu_kernel(\n        x_ptr,\n        output_ptr,\n        alpha,\n        n_elements,\n        BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n   ):\n        pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n        block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n        offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < n_elements\n        x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n\n        # Compute ELU\n        # For x>0: x, else: alpha*(exp(x)-1)\n        zero = 0.0\n        zero = zero.to(x.dtype)  # ensure same dtype\n        condition = x > zero\n        exp_x = tl.exp(x)\n        exp_x_minus_one = exp_x - 1\n        result = tl.where(condition, x, alpha * exp_x_minus_one)\n\n        tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, result, mask=mask)\n   ```\n\n 11. Then in the forward method of ModelNew:\n        - We will flatten the input (if necessary) but note: the output must have the same shape as input.\n        - Actually, we can process the tensor without flattening because the kernel is element-wise and we are using a 1D grid.\n\n        Steps:\n          output = torch.empty_like(x)\n          n_elements = x.numel()\n          grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n          elu_kernel[grid](x, output, self.alpha, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)\n\n        But note: the input might be non-contiguous? We should make sure it's contiguous.\n\n 12. We must consider the data type. The input is float32 (from torch.randn). We'll assume float32.\n\n 13. We'll also note that the kernel must be compiled for the specific device of the tensor.\n\n 14. We must include the necessary imports for Triton.\n\n 15. We are allowed to change only the EVOLVE-BLOCK. So we replace the entire ModelNew class and also the helper functions (get_inputs, get_init_inputs) if needed? \n     But note: the original get_inputs returns a tensor of [batch_size, dim]. Our kernel uses the total number of elements, so we don't change the shape.\n\n 16. We must not change the batch_size and dim? Actually, we are not changing them.\n\n 17. We also note that the model is initialized with an alpha. We pass that to the kernel.\n\n 18. We must test the correctness? But the task says we are to rewrite and then the evaluation pipeline will check.\n\n 19. We'll write the kernel and the new ModelNew class.\n\n 20. We also note that the current program has a reference implementation that uses F.elu. We are replacing that with our Triton kernel.\n\n 21. We must be cautious about the data types: the kernel should work for float32.\n\n 22. We will set a fixed BLOCK_SIZE for now and then we can use autotune later? But the task says we can do adaptive tuning.\n\n 23. However, the task constraints: \n     - Do not change grid configuration? Actually, we are setting the grid as (triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE),) which is standard.\n\n 24. We are allowed to change the Triton kernel source. So we are going to write a kernel and then call it.\n\n 25. We note that the current program does not use Triton at all. We are introducing it.\n\n 26. We also note that the current performance: \n        reference_timing_ms: 0.0246, custom_timing: 0.0162, speed_up: 1.519 (which is the reference PyTorch time divided by the custom time? But note: the current custom is the same as the reference because we are using F.elu? Actually, the current program is the reference.)\n\n     We are now going to write a custom Triton kernel to replace F.elu.\n\n 27. We hope to get a speedup.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Important: The output must be exactly the same as the original ELU.\n\n We are going to write the Triton kernel and the new ModelNew.\n\n We must include the necessary imports for Triton.\n\n Since the EVOLVE-BLOCK must be self-contained, we will include the Triton imports inside the block.\n\n But note: the previous code does not have Triton. We are adding it.\n\n However, the evaluation environment has Triton? We assume it does.\n\n We'll write:\n\n   import triton\n   import triton.language as tl\n\n And then the kernel and the model.\n\n We must be cautious: the kernel must be compiled and run on the same device as the input.\n\n We'll modify the ModelNew class to use the Triton kernel in the forward pass.\n\n Also, we must note that the input tensor might be on CUDA. We assume it is.\n\n We'll set the grid and launch the kernel.\n\n We choose a BLOCK_SIZE of 1024. We can try to autotune but for simplicity we start with 1024.\n\n Alternatively, we can use triton.autotune? But the task says we can do adaptive tuning. However, for the first step, we can do without.\n\n We are going to write:\n\n   class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        ... same __init__ ...\n\n        def forward(self, x):\n            # Flatten the tensor to 1D for simplicity? But note: the output must have the same shape.\n            # We can work with the contiguous flattened view and then reshape back.\n            output = torch.empty_like(x)\n            n_elements = x.numel()\n            if n_elements == 0:\n                return output\n            grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n            # We use a fixed block size? Let's set 1024 for now.\n            elu_kernel[grid](x, output, self.alpha, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)\n            return output\n\n 28. We must write the kernel as shown above.\n\n 29. We also note that the kernel must handle the boundary: we are using a mask in the load and store.\n\n 30. We are going to write the kernel with the condition.\n\n 31. We note that the condition uses a zero of the same data type as x. Since x is float32, we can write zero=0.0 and it will be float32.\n\n 32. We also note that the exponential might be expensive. We hope that processing in blocks and having many threads will help.\n\n 33. We must test for correctness in the evaluation pipeline.\n\n 34. We are not changing the batch_size and dim, and the get_inputs and get_init_inputs remain the same.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the current program has:\n        batch_size = 16\n        dim = 16384\n\n    So the total elements per tensor: 16 * 16384 = 262144.\n\n    We'll set the grid to (262144 / 1024) = 256 blocks.\n\n 35. We are ready to write the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n IMPORTANT: The entire code must be within the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n We are going to replace the entire ModelNew class and add the kernel.\n\n But note: the original code had only the ModelNew class and the helper functions. We are going to keep the helper functions the same.\n\n We write:\n\n   import triton\n   import triton.language as tl\n\n   @triton.jit\n   def elu_kernel(x_ptr, output_ptr, alpha, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n        ... as above ...\n\n   class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        ... __init__ same ...\n\n        def forward(self, x):\n            ... as above ...\n\n   batch_size = 16\n   dim = 16384\n   ... same helper functions ...\n\n However, note: the original ModelNew had a docstring. We keep it.\n\n Let's write the code.\n\n But note: the original code had imports: torch, torch.nn, torch.nn.functional. We are keeping those and adding triton and tl.\n\n We must be cautious: the kernel must be defined at the top level? Yes.\n\n We are going to write the kernel inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n Since the kernel is defined with @triton.jit, it will be compiled.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n We note: the current program has a speed_up of 1.0 (because it is the reference). We hope to get >1.\n\n However, note: the current custom_timing is 0.0162 ms for the reference? Actually, the meta says:\n        'reference_timing_ms': 0.0246, 'speed_up': 1.519, 'custom_timing': 0.0162\n\n    This is confusing. The current program is the reference and it runs in 0.0246 ms? Then the custom_timing (which is the same as the reference) is 0.0162? \n    Actually, the custom_timing is for the current custom code? But in the reference code, there is no custom code? \n\n    We are going to replace the reference code with a custom Triton kernel.\n\n    We hope to get a custom_timing that is lower than 0.0162? Or lower than 0.0246? \n\n    The speed_up is defined as reference_timing / custom_timing. Currently, it's 0.0246 / 0.0162 = 1.519? \n\n    But wait: the current program is the reference? How can it have a custom_timing? \n\n    Actually, the evaluation system runs the reference code (PyTorch) and then the custom code (which in the current version is the same as the reference). \n\n    Now we are replacing the custom code with a Triton kernel. We hope that the custom_timing becomes lower and thus the speed_up becomes higher.\n\n    We are going to try.\n\n 36. We write the kernel for float32.\n\n 37. We note that the input is from `torch.randn` which is float32.\n\n 38. We also note that the kernel uses `tl.exp` which supports float32.\n\n 39. We write the kernel.\n\n 40. We also note: the kernel must be compiled. We set the grid and block appropriately.\n\n 41. We are going to set the BLOCK_SIZE to 1024. We can try to autotune in the future, but for now we use a fixed value.\n\n Let's write the code.\n</think>\n```python\n\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef elu_kernel(\n    x_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    alpha,\n    n_elements,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = offsets < n_elements\n    \n    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    zero = 0.0\n    condition = x > zero\n    exp_x = tl.exp(x)\n    result = tl.where(condition, x, alpha * (exp_x - 1))\n    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, result, mask=mask)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, alpha: float = 1.0):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.alpha = alpha\n    \n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        output = torch.empty_like(x)\n        n_elements = x.numel()\n        if n_elements == 0:\n            return output\n            \n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n        elu_kernel[grid](\n            x, output, self.alpha, n_elements,\n            BLOCK_SIZE=1024\n        )\n        return output\n\nbatch_size = 16\ndim = 16384\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    x = torch.randn(batch_size, dim)\n    return [x]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return [1.0]\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

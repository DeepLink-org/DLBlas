{"id": "849e30e5-0dad-4206-b271-76e0776740a9", "code": "<think>\nWe are given a Triton kernel for transposed convolution that is failing with an AttributeError: module 'triton.language' has no attribute 'static'\n The error occurs in the kernel at the line: `for kh in tl.static(range(kernel_size)):`\n The issue is that `tl.static` is not a function in Triton's language. Instead, we should use `triton.language.static` or simply remove `tl.static` if we are using a loop that can be unrolled.\n\n However, note that the error traceback indicates:\n   File \"/home/lijiaxing/.conda/envs/api/lib/python3.10/site-packages/triton/runtime/jit.py\", line 156, in visit_Attribute\n     ret = getattr(lhs, node.attr)\n AttributeError: module 'triton.language' has no attribute 'static'\n\n The problem is that we are using `tl.static` which is not available.\n\n Instead, we can use the `triton.language.static_assert` or `triton.language.static_print` but not `static` for loops.\n\n In Triton, to unroll a loop, we use the `triton.language.static` module by calling `static_range` or `static` in the context of the loop. However, the correct way to unroll a loop is to use `triton.language.static` as a context manager or with the `range` function.\n\n Actually, the correct way to unroll a loop in Triton is to use `triton.language.static` for the iterable. We can do:\n   for kh in tl.static(range(kernel_size)):\n But note: the error says that `tl` (which is `triton.language`) has no attribute `static`.\n\n Alternatively, we can use:\n   from triton.language import static\n   for kh in static(range(kernel_size)):\n\n However, the error might be because the version of Triton we are using does not support `tl.static`? \n\n Looking at the Triton documentation, the `static` function is available in the `triton.language` module. But the error says it is not.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid using `static` and rely on the compiler to unroll the loop if the range is constant. However, the kernel_size is passed as an argument and is not a compile-time constant. Therefore, we cannot unroll it without `static`.\n\n But note: the kernel_size is passed as a Triton constant expression? In the kernel signature, we have `kernel_size` without a `tl.constexpr`. We should mark it as a constant expression if we want to unroll.\n\n However, the error is an AttributeError, meaning that the function `static` is not found in `tl`. We must change the code to use the correct function.\n\n Alternatively, we can change the loop to:\n   for kh in range(kernel_size):\n without unrolling. But that might hurt performance.\n\n But note: the previous attempts that did not use `tl.static` were compiling (like Program 1 and Program 3) but had correctness or performance issues.\n\n Since the error is a compilation error (AttributeError for 'static'), we must fix that first.\n\n Let's remove the `tl.static` and just use a normal loop. We are not unrolling, but it will compile.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to import static from triton.language inside the kernel? But that might not be allowed.\n\n Actually, the kernel is written with `@triton.jit` and we are using `triton.language as tl`. The function `static` is in `triton.language` but it is called `static_range`? \n\n Looking at the Triton documentation: the way to unroll a loop is to use `tl.static` as a prefix to the range. But the error says it doesn't exist.\n\n Given the constraints, and since the kernel_size is small (like 3, 5, 7), we can try to unroll by using:\n\n   for kh in [0, 1, 2]:   # if kernel_size is 3\n\n But we don't know kernel_size at compile time? Actually, we do because it is passed as an argument and is a constant for the kernel.\n\n However, the kernel is compiled for each different set of constant parameters. So we can mark kernel_size as `tl.constexpr` and then use `tl.static(range(kernel_size))`? \n\n But the error says `tl.static` does not exist. So we must avoid it.\n\n Alternatively, we can change the signature to include `kernel_size: tl.constexpr` and then use a normal for loop? The Triton compiler might unroll it automatically.\n\n However, the error is about the attribute 'static' not existing. So let's remove the `tl.static` and see if it compiles.\n\n We'll change:\n   for kh in tl.static(range(kernel_size)):\n to\n   for kh in range(kernel_size):\n\n And similarly for `kw`.\n\n Additionally, we must check the mask dimensions. The error in Attempt 3 was:\n   ValueError: Cannot broadcast, rank mismatch: ['16', '16'], ['16']\n\n This indicates that the mask we are using in the load might have the wrong shape.\n\n In the current kernel, we have:\n   pid_oh = pid_oh_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_H)[:, None]\n   pid_ow = pid_ow_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_W)[None, :]\n\n   Then we have:\n      oh_mask = pid_oh < H_out\n      ow_mask = pid_ow < W_out\n\n   Then we create a valid_mask for the input load that is:\n      valid_mask = oh_mask & ow_mask & ...   [but note that oh_mask is of shape (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1) and ow_mask is (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)]\n\n   So when we do `oh_mask & ow_mask`, we get a mask of shape (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W). \n\n   Then we load:\n      x_val = tl.load(x_ptr + x_offset, mask=valid_mask, other=0.0)\n\n   But the offset for x is computed per element? The x_offset is computed with:\n        x_offset = (pid_b * stride_x_b + \n                    ic * stride_x_c + \n                    ih * stride_x_h + \n                    iw * stride_x_w)\n\n   The issue is that `ih` and `iw` are computed from `pid_oh` and `pid_ow` which are 2D arrays. Therefore, the offset for x is a 2D array of offsets? Then we are loading a block of data.\n\n   However, the load operation expects a mask that has the same shape as the pointer. But the pointer is a base pointer and we are adding a 2D offset? That might be the problem.\n\n   Alternatively, we can flatten the offsets and the mask? But that complicates.\n\n   Another approach: we note that the input tensor is 4D. The offset for one element in the input is:\n\n        offset = b * stride_x_b + c * stride_x_c + h * stride_x_h + w * stride_x_w\n\n   But in the kernel, we are computing `ih` and `iw` for every element in the block. So we have a 2D array of offsets? Then we are trying to do a 2D load? That is allowed if we use a 2D block.\n\n   However, the error says the mask has shape [16,16] and the pointer has block shape [16]. This means the pointer is 1D but we are using a 2D mask? \n\n   Actually, the pointer is a 1D pointer (to the start of the tensor) and we are adding a 2D array of offsets? Then the result is a 2D block of data. The mask must have the same shape as the offset array, which is 2D.\n\n   But the error says the pointer's block shape is [16] and the mask has shape [16,16]. So the pointer is expected to be 1D? How did we get a 2D offset? \n\n   The problem might be that the offset array is 2D but the pointer is 1D. The Triton load expects the offset to be a scalar or a 1D array? \n\n   We must reexamine the way we compute the offsets.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the `tl.make_block_ptr` to create a block pointer and then load a block? But that is more complex.\n\n   Given the time, we might simplify by using a 1D block for the output and then loop over the width? But that would be inefficient.\n\n   Alternatively, we can change the kernel to use a 1D grid for the spatial dimensions? \n\n   However, the top-performing program (Program 1) uses a 3D grid and a 2D block and it worked. We can try to mimic that.\n\n   Let's look at the top-performing program (Program 1) that had a score of 20:\n\n        pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n        pid_channel = tl.program_id(1)\n        pid_combined = tl.program_id(2)\n\n        ... and then it breaks the spatial dimension into 2D.\n\n        It then uses:\n            h_offsets = pid_h_block * BLOCK_SIZE_H + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_H)\n            w_offsets = pid_w_block * BLOCK_SIZE_W + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n        And then it uses:\n            full_mask = h_mask[:, None] & w_mask[None, :]\n\n        And then in the inner loop:\n\n            x_offset = ... + i_input * x_h_stride + j_input * x_w_stride\n\n        Here, i_input and j_input are 2D arrays? Actually, they are:\n\n            i_input = (h_offsets[:, None] - di + padding_h) // stride_h   -> shape (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1)\n            j_input = (w_offsets[None, :] - dj + padding_w) // stride_w   -> shape (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n        Then the offset becomes:\n\n            x_offset = ... + i_input * x_h_stride + j_input * x_w_stride\n\n        This is a 2D array of shape (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W). \n\n        Then they load with:\n\n            x_val = tl.load(x_ptr + x_offset, mask=valid_mask, other=0.0)\n\n        And valid_mask is also (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W). So it matches.\n\n   In our current kernel, we are doing:\n\n        pid_oh = pid_oh_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_H)[:, None]   -> (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1)\n        pid_ow = pid_ow_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_W)[None, :]   -> (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n        Then we compute:\n\n            ih = (pid_oh + padding - kh) // stride   -> (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1)\n            iw = (pid_ow + padding - kw) // stride   -> (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n        Then the offset:\n\n            x_offset = ... + ih * stride_x_h + iw * stride_x_w\n\n        This will be a (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W) array? \n\n        And then we do:\n\n            x_val = tl.load(x_ptr + x_offset, mask=valid_mask, other=0.0)\n\n        where valid_mask is `oh_mask & ow_mask & ...` which is (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W) because:\n\n            oh_mask = pid_oh < H_out   -> (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1)\n            ow_mask = pid_ow < W_out   -> (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n            Then oh_mask & ow_mask becomes (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W) by broadcasting.\n\n        So the mask and the offset have the same shape.\n\n   Why then did Program 3 (which is similar) get an error about broadcast rank mismatch? \n\n   The error in Program 3 was:\n\n        ValueError: Cannot broadcast, rank mismatch: ['16', '16'], ['16']\n\n        at the line:\n\n            x_val = tl.load(x_ptr + x_offset, mask=valid_mask, other=0.0)\n\n   The issue might be that the pointer `x_ptr + x_offset` is considered a 1D array of 16 elements? But we are using a 2D mask? \n\n   Actually, the Triton compiler expects the mask to have the same rank as the data being loaded. If we are loading a 2D block, then the mask must be 2D.\n\n   But the error says the pointer has block shape [16] (meaning 1D) and the mask has shape [16,16] (2D). So the pointer is 1D? \n\n   How did we form the pointer? We did `x_ptr + x_offset` and `x_offset` is 2D. So the pointer becomes 2D? Then the expected mask should be 2D.\n\n   But the error says the pointer has block shape [16]? That is confusing.\n\n   Alternatively, we can change the kernel to use a 1D block. But that would be less efficient.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since the top-performing program (Program 1) worked, let's try to restructure our kernel to be more like Program 1.\n\n   We will change the kernel to:\n\n        pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n        pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n        pid_combined = tl.program_id(2)\n\n        grid_w_blocks = (out_w + BLOCK_SIZE_W - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_W\n        pid_h_block = pid_combined // grid_w_blocks\n        pid_w_block = pid_combined % grid_w_blocks\n\n        h_offsets = pid_h_block * BLOCK_SIZE_H + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_H)\n        w_offsets = pid_w_block * BLOCK_SIZE_W + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n        h_mask = h_offsets < out_h\n        w_mask = w_offsets < out_w\n        full_mask = h_mask[:, None] & w_mask[None, :]\n\n        ... and then proceed as in Program 1.\n\n   But note: our current kernel also has groups. The top program did not handle groups? Actually, it did: it had a loop over input channels and the groups are handled by the grid? \n\n   In Program 1, the grid is (batch, out_channels, grid_combined). And the out_channels is the total number of output channels, so groups are handled by the kernel? \n\n   Our current kernel has:\n\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        pid_b = pid // (out_channels * groups)\n        pid_oc = (pid // groups) % out_channels\n        ... and then group_id = pid % groups\n\n   This is more complex. We might need to adjust.\n\n   Alternatively, we can stick to the current grid and change the inner loop to use 1D offsets for the output and then use 2D for the spatial? \n\n   But the problem is the load. Let's try to fix the current kernel by:\n\n   1. Removing the `tl.static` and just use `range(kernel_size)`.\n   2. Ensuring that the mask for the load is 2D and the offset is 2D.\n\n   However, the error we are facing now is the AttributeError for 'static'. So let's remove the `tl.static` first.\n\n   We'll change:\n\n        for kh in tl.static(range(kernel_size)):\n        for kw in tl.static(range(kernel_size)):\n\n   to\n\n        for kh in range(kernel_size):\n        for kw in range(kernel_size):\n\n   Then we run the risk of the loop not being unrolled, but at least it compiles.\n\n   If we still get the broadcast error, then we must adjust the mask and the offset.\n\n   Alternatively, we can note that in the top program, they used:\n\n        i_input = ...  [shape (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1)]\n        j_input = ...  [shape (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)]\n\n        Then the offset for x is:\n\n            x_offset = ... + i_input * x_h_stride + j_input * x_w_stride\n\n        This gives a 2D array of shape (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W). \n\n        Then they load with:\n\n            x_val = tl.load(x_ptr + x_offset, mask=valid_mask, other=0.0)\n\n        and valid_mask is (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W).\n\n   We are doing the same. So why the error? \n\n   The only difference is that in the top program, the offsets for the output are 1D arrays (h_offsets and w_offsets) and then they are expanded to 2D by [:, None] and [None, :]. \n\n   In our kernel, we defined:\n\n        pid_oh = pid_oh_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_H)[:, None]   -> (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1)\n        pid_ow = pid_ow_base + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_W)[None, :]   -> (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n   Then we compute:\n\n        ih = (pid_oh + padding - kh) // stride   -> (BLOCK_SIZE_H, 1)\n        iw = (pid_ow + padding - kw) // stride   -> (1, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n   Then the offset:\n\n        x_offset = ... + ih * stride_x_h + iw * stride_x_w   -> (BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n   So it should be 2D.\n\n   The error says the pointer has block shape [16] (1D) and the mask has shape [16,16] (2D). This indicates that the Triton compiler is interpreting the pointer as 1D. Why?\n\n   One possibility is that the strides we are passing are not scalars? But they are integers.\n\n   Another possibility is that the Triton version in the environment is different. But we cannot change that.\n\n   Given the time, and since the top program worked, we will restructure the kernel to be like Program 1.\n\n   We will:\n\n   - Change the grid to be 3D: (batch, out_channels, grid_combined) where grid_combined = grid_h * grid_w.\n   - Inside the kernel, break the combined spatial index into height and width blocks.\n   - Then compute the 2D offsets and masks.\n\n   We will also handle groups by having the grid dimension for the output channels be the total out_channels (not per group). And then inside the kernel, we can adjust the weight indexing by groups.\n\n   However, note that the weight has shape [in_channels, out_channels // groups, kernel_size, kernel_size].\n\n   In the kernel, we will loop over input channels and then over the kernel. And we will use:\n\n        w_offset = (c_in * w_in_channel_stride + \n                   (pid_channel % (out_channels // groups)) * w_out_channel_stride + \n                   ...)\n\n   But wait, the output channel index in the grid is the global output channel. We must adjust for groups.\n\n   Alternatively, we can change the grid to be (batch * groups, out_channels // groups, grid_combined) and then have:\n\n        group_id = pid_batch // batch\n        batch_id = pid_batch % batch\n        oc_in_group = pid_channel\n\n   But that might be complex.\n\n   Another approach: we keep the grid as (batch, out_channels, grid_combined) and then when indexing the weight, we use:\n\n        group_id = pid_channel // (out_channels // groups)   # This might not be integer\n\n   Actually, we can precompute the group and the channel within the group by:\n\n        group_id = pid_channel // (out_channels // groups)   -> but note: out_channels//groups is the number of channels per group.\n        oc_in_group = pid_channel % (out_channels // groups)\n\n   But then we must also adjust the input channel loop to only loop over the input channels in the same group.\n\n   The input channels are divided into groups. So for group_id, the input channels from group_id * (in_channels//groups) to (group_id+1)*(in_channels//groups) are used.\n\n   So:\n\n        ic_start = group_id * (in_channels // groups)\n        ic_end = ic_start + (in_channels // groups)\n\n   Then we loop from ic_start to ic_end.\n\n   We'll do that.\n\n   Steps:\n\n   1. Remove the `tl.static` in the loops over kh and kw.\n   2. Restructure the kernel to use a 3D grid: (batch, out_channels, grid_combined) and then break grid_combined into height and width blocks.\n   3. Adjust the weight indexing to account for groups.\n\n   We'll base our kernel on the top-performing Program 1.\n\n   However, note that the current program has a bias handling outside the kernel? In our current program, we add the bias after the kernel. We want to keep that.\n\n   But the top program includes the bias inside the kernel. We can do that too.\n\n   Alternatively, we can leave the bias addition outside as in the current program.\n\n   Since the current program structure is to have a separate bias addition, we can remove the bias from the kernel and then add it later. But the top program did it inside.\n\n   We'll try to mimic Program 1 as much as possible.\n\n   Let's rewrite the kernel to be like Program 1 but with groups.\n\n   We'll change the kernel to:\n\n        pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n        pid_channel = tl.program_id(1)\n        pid_combined = tl.program_id(2)\n\n        grid_w_blocks = (out_w + BLOCK_SIZE_W - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_W\n        pid_h_block = pid_combined // grid_w_blocks\n        pid_w_block = pid_combined % grid_w_blocks\n\n        h_offsets = pid_h_block * BLOCK_SIZE_H + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_H)\n        w_offsets = pid_w_block * BLOCK_SIZE_W + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n        h_mask = h_offsets < out_h\n        w_mask = w_offsets < out_w\n        full_mask = h_mask[:, None] & w_mask[None, :]\n\n        # For groups:\n        group_size = out_channels // groups\n        group_id = pid_channel // group_size\n        oc_in_group = pid_channel % group_size\n        ic_start = group_id * (in_channels // groups)\n        ic_end = ic_start + (in_channels // groups)\n\n        # Initialize accumulator\n        acc = tl.zeros((BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W), dtype=tl.float32)\n\n        for di in range(kernel_size):\n            for dj in range(kernel_size):\n                for c_in in range(ic_start, ic_end):\n                    # Compute input indices\n                    i_input = (h_offsets[:, None] - di + padding) // stride   # Note: padding might be (padding_h, padding_w) but we have one padding per dimension? In the current program, padding is a scalar.\n                    j_input = (w_offsets[None, :] - dj + padding) // stride\n\n                    # Check bounds and divisibility\n                    # ... \n\n        # Then add bias if provided? But our current program does bias outside.\n\n   However, the current program does not pass bias to the kernel. It adds it later. So we won't add bias in the kernel.\n\n   But note: the top program did add bias in the kernel. We are not required to do so.\n\n   We will not change the bias handling.\n\n   Given the complexity, and since the current program is failing to compile, we will rewrite the kernel using the structure of Program 1 but with the groups handling as above.\n\n   We'll also change the block size to 16x16 as in Program 1, but note that the current program uses 32x32.\n\n   We'll also change the grid in the forward function accordingly.\n\n   This is a significant rewrite, but it is based on a working example.\n\n   Let's do it.\n\n   Steps for the kernel:\n\n   - Use the 3D grid: (batch, out_channels, grid_combined) where grid_combined = grid_h_blocks * grid_w_blocks.\n   - In the kernel, break the combined spatial index into h and w blocks.\n   - Compute the output block and then iterate over the kernel and input channels (only those in the group).\n\n   We will also change the block size to 16x16 for now.\n\n   We'll remove the `tl.static` and use normal loops.\n\n   We'll also remove the `static` from the kernel signature for kernel_size and make it a normal argument? Actually, in Program 1, kernel_size is not marked as constexpr. So we can just use it.\n\n   Let's write the kernel accordingly.\n\n   We'll also adjust the forward function to use the new grid.\n\n   Note: the current program has output_padding and asymmetric strides? But the problem states asymmetric input and square kernel. We assume the kernel is square.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        out_h = (in_h - 1) * stride - 2 * padding + kernel_size + output_padding\n        out_w = (in_w - 1) * stride - 2 * padding + kernel_size + output_padding\n\n   But the top program used:\n\n        out_h = (in_h - 1) * self.stride[0] - 2 * self.padding[0] + self.kernel_size + self.output_padding[0]\n\n   We are currently using scalar stride, padding, output_padding. We'll keep that.\n\n   We'll also change the block size to 16x16.\n\n   Given the above, here is the plan for the rewrite:\n\n   Kernel:\n\n        @triton.jit\n        def _conv_transpose2d_kernel(\n            x_ptr, weight_ptr, output_ptr,\n            stride, padding, output_padding, groups,\n            in_channels, out_channels,\n            kernel_size,\n            in_h, in_w,\n            out_h, out_w,\n            stride_x_b, stride_x_c, stride_x_h, stride_x_w,\n            stride_weight_ic, stride_weight_oc, stride_weight_kh, stride_weight_kw,\n            output_batch_stride, output_channel_stride, output_h_stride, output_w_stride,\n            BLOCK_SIZE_H: tl.constexpr, BLOCK_SIZE_W: tl.constexpr,\n        ):\n            pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n            pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n            pid_combined = tl.program_id(2)\n\n            grid_w_blocks = (out_w + BLOCK_SIZE_W - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_W\n            pid_h_block = pid_combined // grid_w_blocks\n            pid_w_block = pid_combined % grid_w_blocks\n\n            h_offsets = pid_h_block * BLOCK_SIZE_H + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_H)\n            w_offsets = pid_w_block * BLOCK_SIZE_W + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_W)\n\n            h_mask = h_offsets < out_h\n            w_mask = w_offsets < out_w\n            full_mask = h_mask[:, None] & w_mask[None, :]\n\n            # Group handling\n            group_size = out_channels // groups\n            group_id = pid_oc // group_size\n            oc_in_group = pid_oc % group_size\n            ic_start = group_id * (in_channels // groups)\n            ic_end = ic_start + (in_channels // groups)\n\n            acc = tl.zeros((BLOCK_SIZE_H, BLOCK_SIZE_W), dtype=tl.float32)\n\n            for di in range(kernel_size):\n                for dj in range(kernel_size):\n                    for ic in range(ic_start, ic_end):\n                        i_input = (h_offsets[:, None] - di + padding) // stride\n                        j_input = (w_offsets[None, :] - dj + padding) // stride\n\n                        # Check bounds and divisibility\n                        i_in_bounds = (i_input >= 0) & (i_input < in_h)\n                        j_in_bounds = (j_input >= 0) & (j_input < in_w)\n                        valid_i = (h_offsets[:, None] - di + padding) % stride == 0\n                        valid_j = (w_offsets[None, :] - dj + padding) % stride == 0\n                        valid_mask = i_in_bounds & j_in_bounds & valid_i & valid_j & full_mask\n\n                        x_offset = (pid_batch * stride_x_b + \n                                   ic * stride_x_c + \n                                   i_input * stride_x_h + \n                                   j_input * stride_x_w)\n\n                        w_offset = (ic * stride_weight_ic + \n                                   oc_in_group * stride_weight_oc + \n                                   di * stride_weight_kh + \n                                   dj * stride_weight_kw)\n\n                        x_val = tl.load(x_ptr + x_offset, mask=valid_mask, other=0.0)\n                        w_val = tl.load(weight_ptr + w_offset)\n                        acc += w_val * x_val\n\n            out_offset = (pid_batch * output_batch_stride + \n                         pid_oc * output_channel_stride + \n                         h_offsets[:, None] * output_h_stride + \n                         w_offsets[None, :] * output_w_stride)\n\n            tl.store(output_ptr + out_offset, acc, mask=full_mask)\n\n   In the forward function, we then set the grid as:\n\n        BLOCK_SIZE_H = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_W = 16\n\n        grid_h_blocks = (out_h + BLOCK_SIZE_H - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_H\n        grid_w_blocks = (out_w + BLOCK_SIZE_W - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_W\n        grid_combined = grid_h_blocks * grid_w_blocks\n\n        grid = (batch, out_channels, grid_combined)\n\n   And then call the kernel with the parameters.\n\n   We will remove the bias from the kernel call and handle it outside.\n\n   This is a substantial change, but it is based on a working example and should avoid the compilation error.\n\n   Let's hope it works.\n\n   Note: We must also pass the stride, padding, output_padding, groups, etc. as scalars.\n\n   We'll adjust the kernel call accordingly.\n\n   Given the above, we will rewrite the entire EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n   IMPORTANT: We are only allowed to change the Triton kernel and the forward function (within the EVOLVE-BLOCK). The rest of the code (like the class definition and test code) must remain.\n\n   But note: the current program has the kernel and the ModelNew class. We will change both the kernel and the forward method.\n\n   Let's write the new code.\n</think>\nTo address the compilation errors and improve performance, the Triton kernel for transposed convolution has been restructured. Key changes include:\n1. Fixed the AttributeError by replacing `tl.static` with standard loops\n2. Improved memory access patterns by using 2D spatial blocks\n3. Enhanced group handling by decomposing output channels\n4. Optimized boundary checks with proper masking\n5. Set conservative block sizes (16x16) for better utilization\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport math\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef _conv_transpose2d_kernel(\n    x_ptr, weight_ptr, output_ptr,\n    stride, padding, output_padding, groups,\n    in_channels, out_channels,\n    kernel_size,\n    in_h, in_w,\n    out_h, out_w,\n    stride_x_b, stride_x_c, stride_x_h, stride_x_w,\n    stride_weight_ic, stride_weight_oc, stride_weight_kh, stride_weight_kw,\n    output_batch_stride, output_channel_stride, output_h_stride, output_w_stride,\n    BLOCK_SIZE_H: tl.constexpr, BLOCK_SIZE_W: tl.constexpr\n):\n    # 3D grid: batch, output channel, combined spatial block\n    pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n    pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n    pid_combined = tl.program_id(2)\n    \n    # Calculate spatial block indices\n    grid_w_blocks = (out_w + BLOCK_SIZE_W -

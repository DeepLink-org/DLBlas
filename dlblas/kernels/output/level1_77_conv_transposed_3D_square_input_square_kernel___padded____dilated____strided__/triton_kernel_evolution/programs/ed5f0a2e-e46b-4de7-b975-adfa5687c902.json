Actually, we have three separate conditions.\n\n Let me clarify the code:\n\n     stride_cond_d = ((d_offsets - dilation * kd + padding) % stride == 0)   # [BLOCK_D]\n     stride_cond_h = ...   # [BLOCK_H]\n     stride_cond_w = ...   # [BLOCK_W]\n\n     Then we try to combine them as:\n         valid_mask &= stride_cond_d[:, None, None] & stride_cond_h[None, :, None] & stride_cond_w[None, None, :]\n\n But in the current code, the variable `stride_cond` is computed for each dimension and then we try to use the same variable for all three in the expression.\n\n Actually, the code has:\n\n     stride_cond = ((d_offsets - dilation * kd + padding) % stride == 0) & \\\n                   ((h_offsets - dilation * kh + padding) % stride == 0) & \\\n                   ((w_offsets - dilation * kw + padding) % stride == 0)\n\n This is incorrect because we are combining three vectors of different lengths (BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W) with `&` which requires the same shape.\n\n We cannot combine them directly. Instead, we should create three separate conditions and then broadcast them appropriately.\n\n The fix is to assign each condition to a separate variable and then broadcast each to the 3D block shape.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid the intermediate `stride_cond` and directly create the 3D mask by broadcasting each condition.\n\n Let's change the code inside the kernel:\n\n     # ... [previous code]\n\n     # Instead of the current stride_cond, we do:\n     stride_cond_d = ((d_offsets - dilation * kd + padding) % stride == 0)   # [BLOCK_D]\n     stride_cond_h = ((h_offsets - dilation * kh + padding) % stride == 0)   # [BLOCK_H]\n     stride_cond_w = ((w_offsets - dilation * kw + padding) % stride == 0)   # [BLOCK_W]\n\n     # Now broadcast each to [BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W]\n     mask_stride = stride_cond_d[:, None, None] & stride_cond_h[None, :, None] & stride_cond_w[None, None, :]\n\n     valid_mask &= mask_stride\n\n We also note that the current code for the input indices might be incorrect for transposed convolution?\n But the error is about shape, so let's fix the shape issue first.\n\n Additionally, we observe that the kernel uses `range(0, ...)` which is the same as `range(...)`. We can leave it.\n\n We also note that the kernel is autotuned with multiple configurations. We are not changing the signature.\n\n Another issue: the grid function in the forward pass does not pass the autotune parameters correctly? \n But the error is in the kernel, so we focus on the kernel.\n\n Let's rewrite the kernel part that computes the stride condition.\n\n We are going to replace the lines starting from the definition of `stride_cond` until the `valid_mask` update.\n\n Specifically, we replace:\n\n     stride_cond = ...   # the three combined with & (incorrectly)\n\n     valid_mask &= stride_cond[:, None, None] & ...   # this is also incorrect because we are using the same variable for three different things.\n\n with:\n\n     # Compute stride conditions for each dimension\n     cond_d = (d_offsets - dilation * kd + padding) % stride == 0\n     cond_h = (h_offsets - dilation * kh + padding) % stride == 0\n     cond_w = (w_offsets - dilation * kw + padding) % stride == 0\n\n     # Broadcast to 3D mask\n     mask_stride = cond_d[:, None, None] & cond_h[None, :, None] & cond_w[None, None, :]\n\n     valid_mask &= mask_stride\n\n This should fix the shape issue.\n\n Also note: the original code had a line that tried to combine the three conditions into a 1D vector? That was the mistake.\n\n Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n We are also going to check the output store mask: it uses the same broadcasting pattern and that is correct.\n\n We are making a minimal change to fix the shape error.\n\n However, note that the current program also has a problem in the forward function: it passes the autotune parameters as keyword arguments with fixed values (like BLOCK_D=triton.next_power_of_2(...)) but the autotuner expects to control these. We should remove these and let the autotuner set them.\n\n But looking at the current program, we see that in the forward pass, the call to the kernel does not pass the block sizes as keyword arguments? Actually, in the current program we have:\n\n        conv_transpose3d_kernel[grid](\n            ...,\n            BLOCK_D=triton.next_power_of_2(output_depth // 4),\n            ...   # and similarly for H and W\n        )\n\n This is incorrect because the autotuner will set these block sizes. We should remove these and rely on the autotuner to set them.\n\n But wait, the kernel function has the parameters `BLOCK_D`, `BLOCK_H`, `BLOCK_W` as `tl.constexpr` and they are in the autotune configs. Therefore, we should not pass them explicitly. The autotuner will override them.\n\n So we remove these from the call.\n\n In the current program, the call to the kernel in the forward pass is:\n\n        conv_transpose3d_kernel[grid](\n            ...,\n            output.stride(0), output.stride(1), \n            output.stride(2), output.stride(3), output.stride(4)\n        )\n\n without the block sizes. But in the top-performing program (Program 1) we see that they were passed. Actually, the current program we are given has:\n\n        conv_transpose3d_kernel[grid](\n            ...,\n            x.stride(0), ...,\n            ...,\n            output.stride(0), ...,\n            BL", "language": "python", "parent_id": "d9cc48c6-8c8e-4157-9984-d6a3848149f5", "generation": 3, "timestamp": 1754647611.3939147, "iteration_found": 21, "metrics": {"compiled": false, "correctness": false, "score": -100.0, "stage": "no_valid_triton_code", "feedback": "You need to generate real and valid triton code for the core function.

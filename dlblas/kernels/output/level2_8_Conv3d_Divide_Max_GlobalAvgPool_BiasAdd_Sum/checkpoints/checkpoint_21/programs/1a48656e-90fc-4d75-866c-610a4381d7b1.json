{"id": "1a48656e-90fc-4d75-866c-610a4381d7b1", "code": "<think>\nWe are given a program that currently fails at the compilation stage due to using too many program_id axes (only 0,1,2 are allowed, but we are using 4: pid_batch, pid_oc, pid_d, pid_h, pid_w). The error is:\n    ValueError: program_id axis must be 0, 1, or 2 but got 3\n\n We must restructure the kernel to use at most 3 dimensions for program_id.\n\n Approach:\n We can combine the spatial dimensions (d, h, w) into a single dimension. We note that the grid is 5-dimensional: \n   (batch, out_channels, D_blocks, H_blocks, W_blocks)\n\n We can flatten the last three dimensions (out_channels, D_blocks, H_blocks, W_blocks) into one? \n But note: the kernel uses 5 program_id dimensions. We have to map these 5 dimensions to 3.\n\n We can do:\n   pid_0 = batch\n   pid_1 = out_channels\n   pid_2 = a combined index for (d, h, w) blocks.\n\n How to combine (d, h, w) into one?\n   Let:\n      num_d_blocks = triton.cdiv(D_out, BLOCK_D)\n      num_h_blocks = triton.cdiv(H_out, BLOCK_H)\n      num_w_blocks = triton.cdiv(W_out, BLOCK_W)\n\n   Then the total number of spatial blocks per (batch, oc) is: num_blocks = num_d_blocks * num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n\n   Then we can set:\n      pid_2 = (d_block_index * (num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks) + h_block_index * num_w_blocks + w_block_index)\n\n   But note: we are already using pid_0 for batch and pid_1 for oc. Then we have one dimension left (pid_2) for the spatial blocks.\n\n However, the grid would then be (batch_size, out_channels, num_blocks). This is 3-dimensional.\n\n Steps in the kernel:\n   pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n   pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n   pid_spatial = tl.program_id(2)\n\n   Then we decompose pid_spatial:\n      w_blocks = num_w_blocks\n      hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * w_blocks\n      d_block_idx = pid_spatial // hw_blocks\n      hw_remaining = pid_spatial % hw_blocks\n      h_block_idx = hw_remaining // w_blocks\n      w_block_idx = hw_remaining % w_blocks\n\n   Then the starting indices for the block are:\n      d0 = d_block_idx * BLOCK_D\n      h0 = h_block_idx * BLOCK_H\n      w0 = w_block_idx * BLOCK_W\n\n We must compute the number of blocks for d, h, w inside the kernel? \n But note: the kernel does not know the number of blocks in h and w until runtime.\n\n We can pass the number of blocks in h and w as kernel arguments? Alternatively, we can precompute the total number of blocks and then decompose.\n\n However, note that we cannot use tl.cdiv in the kernel because the kernel is compiled. We must pass the number of blocks in h and w as arguments.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the number of blocks in the host and then pass the combined spatial dimension as the grid size for axis 2.\n\n But the problem: the kernel uses the block sizes (BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W) which are compile-time constants. So we can compute the number of blocks for each spatial dimension on the host and then pass them as kernel arguments? Actually, we don't need to pass them because we are only using the block indices to compute the starting point. Instead, we can compute:\n\n   total_spatial_blocks = num_d_blocks * num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n\n   and then in the kernel, we can recover the block indices by:\n\n      w_blocks = num_w_blocks   -> but we don't have this in the kernel.\n\n How about we pass the number of blocks in the w and h dimensions? We can pass:\n   num_w_blocks: the number of blocks in the width dimension (triton.cdiv(W_out, BLOCK_W)) -> but note BLOCK_W is a compile-time constant, so we can compute it on the host and pass as an argument? However, the kernel is compiled for each configuration (with different BLOCK_*). So we can compute the number of blocks for each dimension in the grid function and pass as kernel arguments.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid passing by recomputing in the kernel? But we don't have the output dimensions? Actually, we do: output_depth, output_height, output_width are passed. And we have BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W as constexpr. So we can compute:\n\n   num_d_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_depth, BLOCK_D)\n   num_h_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_height, BLOCK_H)\n   num_w_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_width, BLOCK_W)\n\n   Then:\n      w_blocks = num_w_blocks\n      hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * w_blocks\n      d_block_idx = pid_spatial // hw_blocks\n      hw_remaining = pid_spatial % hw_blocks\n      h_block_idx = hw_remaining // w_blocks\n      w_block_idx = hw_remaining % w_blocks\n\n However, note: tl.cdiv is not available in the kernel? We can compute:\n\n   num_d_blocks = (output_depth + BLOCK_D - 1) // BLOCK_D\n   similarly for h and w.\n\n But note: output_depth, output_height, output_width are passed as kernel arguments.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W   [integer division]\n\n However, we must be cautious: tl has integer arithmetic. We can do:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n But note: output_width might not be divisible by BLOCK_W.\n\n Actually, we can use:\n\n   num_w_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_width, BLOCK_W)   -> but is tl.cdiv available in the kernel? \n\n Looking at the Triton documentation: yes, tl.cdiv is available in the kernel.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n But note: in Triton, we are dealing with tensors? Actually, output_width is a scalar argument. So we can do integer arithmetic.\n\n However, we must use the same integer arithmetic as tl.cdiv. We can do:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n This is safe.\n\n Steps:\n\n   In the kernel, we will:\n\n      pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n      pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n      pid_spatial = tl.program_id(2)\n\n      num_d_blocks = (output_depth + BLOCK_D - 1) // BLOCK_D\n      num_h_blocks = (output_height + BLOCK_H - 1) // BLOCK_H\n      num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n      total_hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n      total_dhw_blocks = num_d_blocks * total_hw_blocks\n\n      # Since we have pid_spatial in [0, total_dhw_blocks), we can decompose:\n\n      d_block_idx = pid_spatial // total_hw_blocks\n      hw_remaining = pid_spatial % total_hw_blocks\n      h_block_idx = hw_remaining // num_w_blocks\n      w_block_idx = hw_remaining % num_w_blocks\n\n   Then the starting indices:\n\n      d0 = d_block_idx * BLOCK_D\n      h0 = h_block_idx * BLOCK_H\n      w0 = w_block_idx * BLOCK_W\n\n   Then proceed as before.\n\n But note: the autotuner uses the key ['output_depth', 'output_height', 'output_width'] for the configs. The block sizes (BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W) are compile-time constants. So we can compute the number of blocks per dimension.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the kernel must be efficient and avoid expensive operations. The above decomposition is just integer arithmetic and is cheap.\n\n Let's restructure the kernel accordingly.\n\n Also, we must adjust the grid function:\n\n   Currently, the grid function is:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            return (\n                x.size(0),  # batch size\n                self.out_channels,  # output channels\n                triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D']),\n                triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H']),\n                triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W']),\n            )\n\n   Now we want:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            d_blocks = triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D'])\n            h_blocks = triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H'])\n            w_blocks = triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W'])\n            num_spatial_blocks = d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks\n            return (x.size(0), self.out_channels, num_spatial_blocks)\n\n   This grid has 3 dimensions.\n\n We also remove the autotune key? The autotune key remains the same because we are still using the same dimensions.\n\n However, note: the autotuner uses the key to index the configs. The key is a list of argument names. We are still passing output_depth, output_height, output_width. So it's okay.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will change the kernel to have 3 program_id dimensions.\n\n   We remove the old pid_d, pid_h, pid_w and replace with a single pid_spatial.\n\n   Then we compute the block indices as described.\n\n   We also change the grid function to return a 3-tuple.\n\n Let's write the kernel accordingly.\n\n Important: We must not change the kernel signature (parameter names) because the autotuner uses them.\n\n Steps in the kernel:\n\n   Replace the 5 program_id with 3.\n\n   Then compute:\n\n        pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n        pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n        pid_spatial = tl.program_id(2)\n\n        # Compute the number of blocks in each spatial dimension\n        num_d_blocks = (output_depth + BLOCK_D - 1) // BLOCK_D\n        num_h_blocks = (output_height + BLOCK_H - 1) // BLOCK_H\n        num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n        total_hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n        total_dhw_blocks = num_d_blocks * total_hw_blocks\n\n        # Check: pid_spatial should be in [0, total_dhw_blocks)\n        # Now decompose pid_spatial:\n        d_block_idx = pid_spatial // total_hw_blocks\n        hw_remaining = pid_spatial % total_hw_blocks\n        h_block_idx = hw_remaining // num_w_blocks\n        w_block_idx = hw_remaining % num_w_blocks\n\n        d0 = d_block_idx * BLOCK_D\n        h0 = h_block_idx * BLOCK_H\n        w0 = w_block_idx * BLOCK_W\n\n   Then the rest of the kernel remains the same.\n\n But note: the kernel uses the block starting indices (d0, h0, w0) and then loads a block of size (BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W). We must ensure that we don't go out of bounds, but we already have the mask.\n\n However, note: the number of blocks computed by the grid is the same as the total number of spatial blocks (d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks). So each block is covered.\n\n Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n Also, note: the kernel might have performance implications because we are doing integer division and modulus? But these are scalar operations and the dimensions are small (the number of blocks is not huge). So it should be acceptable.\n\n We will now rewrite the kernel to use 3 program_id dimensions.\n\n We must be cautious: the kernel must still be correct.\n\n We'll also update the grid function to return (batch_size, out_channels, d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks).\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Note: We are only changing the program_id handling and the grid function. The rest of the kernel remains the same.\n\n However, note: the kernel uses the original block_mask which uses the output dimensions to mask the block. That part remains unchanged.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n Also, note: the autotuner might have issues? The autotuner uses the key ['output_depth', 'output_height', 'output_width'] which are still passed. So it should be fine.\n\n We are going to change the kernel and the grid function.\n\n We'll replace the current kernel with the following:\n\n   We remove the 5 program_id axes and use 3.\n\n   Then compute the block indices as above.\n\n   The rest of the kernel is the same.\n\n We must also update the grid function in the host code.\n\n Let's write the new kernel and grid function.\n\n Important: We are only allowed to change the Triton kernel source within the EVOLVE-BLOCK. We must not change the surrounding code.\n\n We are going to change:\n\n   - The program_id handling\n   - The grid function\n\n But note: the current program has the grid function defined as:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            return (\n                x.size(0),  # batch size\n                self.out_channels,  # output channels\n                triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D']),\n                triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H']),\n                triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W']),\n            )\n\n We change it to:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            d_blocks = triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D'])\n            h_blocks = triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H'])\n            w_blocks = triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W'])\n            num_spatial_blocks = d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks\n            return (x.size(0), self.out_channels, num_spatial_blocks)\n\n Now we write the kernel accordingly.\n\n Let's update the kernel:\n\n   Remove the old pid_d, pid_h, pid_w and replace with pid_spatial.\n\n   Then compute the block indices as described.\n\n We'll also remove the old comments and restructure accordingly.\n\n We must be cautious: the kernel must not break the constraints (e.g., boundary checks, masks).\n\n We are going to output the entire code block for the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n Since we are only allowed to output the code block, we will write the entire ModelNew class with the updated kernel and grid function.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Modify ONLY the Triton kernel source within this block - all other code is LOCKED.\" But we are also changing the grid function which is in the host code? Actually, the grid function is inside the method `triton_conv_forward`. We are allowed to change it because it's part of the Triton kernel launch.\n\n But note: the instructions say \"all other code is LOCKED\" meaning we cannot change the class structure, the forward method, etc. However, the grid function is part of the kernel launch and is essential for the kernel.\n\n We are going to change:\n\n   - The kernel definition (to use 3 program_id dimensions and the new index computation)\n   - The grid function (to return 3 dimensions)\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n</think>\nTo address the compilation error caused by exceeding Triton's maximum program_id dimensions (only 0, 1, and 2 are allowed), we need to restructure the kernel to use only 3 dimensions. The solution involves:\n\n1. Combining the spatial dimensions (d, h, w) into a single program_id dimension\n2. Calculating spatial block indices using integer arithmetic\n3. Maintaining all performance optimizations (blocking, masking, etc.)\n\nHere's the complete solution:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport

maintains the same inputs and outputs\nas the original program, but with improved internal implementation.\n\n```python\n# Your rewritten program here\n```\n", "responses": ["<think>\nWe are given a program that currently fails at the compilation stage due to using too many program_id axes (only 0,1,2 are allowed, but we are using 4: pid_batch, pid_oc, pid_d, pid_h, pid_w). The error is:\n    ValueError: program_id axis must be 0, 1, or 2 but got 3\n\n We must restructure the kernel to use at most 3 dimensions for program_id.\n\n Approach:\n We can combine the spatial dimensions (d, h, w) into a single dimension. We note that the grid is 5-dimensional: \n   (batch, out_channels, D_blocks, H_blocks, W_blocks)\n\n We can flatten the last three dimensions (out_channels, D_blocks, H_blocks, W_blocks) into one? \n But note: the kernel uses 5 program_id dimensions. We have to map these 5 dimensions to 3.\n\n We can do:\n   pid_0 = batch\n   pid_1 = out_channels\n   pid_2 = a combined index for (d, h, w) blocks.\n\n How to combine (d, h, w) into one?\n   Let:\n      num_d_blocks = triton.cdiv(D_out, BLOCK_D)\n      num_h_blocks = triton.cdiv(H_out, BLOCK_H)\n      num_w_blocks = triton.cdiv(W_out, BLOCK_W)\n\n   Then the total number of spatial blocks per (batch, oc) is: num_blocks = num_d_blocks * num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n\n   Then we can set:\n      pid_2 = (d_block_index * (num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks) + h_block_index * num_w_blocks + w_block_index)\n\n   But note: we are already using pid_0 for batch and pid_1 for oc. Then we have one dimension left (pid_2) for the spatial blocks.\n\n However, the grid would then be (batch_size, out_channels, num_blocks). This is 3-dimensional.\n\n Steps in the kernel:\n   pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n   pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n   pid_spatial = tl.program_id(2)\n\n   Then we decompose pid_spatial:\n      w_blocks = num_w_blocks\n      hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * w_blocks\n      d_block_idx = pid_spatial // hw_blocks\n      hw_remaining = pid_spatial % hw_blocks\n      h_block_idx = hw_remaining // w_blocks\n      w_block_idx = hw_remaining % w_blocks\n\n   Then the starting indices for the block are:\n      d0 = d_block_idx * BLOCK_D\n      h0 = h_block_idx * BLOCK_H\n      w0 = w_block_idx * BLOCK_W\n\n We must compute the number of blocks for d, h, w inside the kernel? \n But note: the kernel does not know the number of blocks in h and w until runtime.\n\n We can pass the number of blocks in h and w as kernel arguments? Alternatively, we can precompute the total number of blocks and then decompose.\n\n However, note that we cannot use tl.cdiv in the kernel because the kernel is compiled. We must pass the number of blocks in h and w as arguments.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute the number of blocks in the host and then pass the combined spatial dimension as the grid size for axis 2.\n\n But the problem: the kernel uses the block sizes (BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W) which are compile-time constants. So we can compute the number of blocks for each spatial dimension on the host and then pass them as kernel arguments? Actually, we don't need to pass them because we are only using the block indices to compute the starting point. Instead, we can compute:\n\n   total_spatial_blocks = num_d_blocks * num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n\n   and then in the kernel, we can recover the block indices by:\n\n      w_blocks = num_w_blocks   -> but we don't have this in the kernel.\n\n How about we pass the number of blocks in the w and h dimensions? We can pass:\n   num_w_blocks: the number of blocks in the width dimension (triton.cdiv(W_out, BLOCK_W)) -> but note BLOCK_W is a compile-time constant, so we can compute it on the host and pass as an argument? However, the kernel is compiled for each configuration (with different BLOCK_*). So we can compute the number of blocks for each dimension in the grid function and pass as kernel arguments.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid passing by recomputing in the kernel? But we don't have the output dimensions? Actually, we do: output_depth, output_height, output_width are passed. And we have BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W as constexpr. So we can compute:\n\n   num_d_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_depth, BLOCK_D)\n   num_h_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_height, BLOCK_H)\n   num_w_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_width, BLOCK_W)\n\n   Then:\n      w_blocks = num_w_blocks\n      hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * w_blocks\n      d_block_idx = pid_spatial // hw_blocks\n      hw_remaining = pid_spatial % hw_blocks\n      h_block_idx = hw_remaining // w_blocks\n      w_block_idx = hw_remaining % w_blocks\n\n However, note: tl.cdiv is not available in the kernel? We can compute:\n\n   num_d_blocks = (output_depth + BLOCK_D - 1) // BLOCK_D\n   similarly for h and w.\n\n But note: output_depth, output_height, output_width are passed as kernel arguments.\n\n So we can do:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W   [integer division]\n\n However, we must be cautious: tl has integer arithmetic. We can do:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n But note: output_width might not be divisible by BLOCK_W.\n\n Actually, we can use:\n\n   num_w_blocks = tl.cdiv(output_width, BLOCK_W)   -> but is tl.cdiv available in the kernel? \n\n Looking at the Triton documentation: yes, tl.cdiv is available in the kernel.\n\n Alternatively, we can compute:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n But note: in Triton, we are dealing with tensors? Actually, output_width is a scalar argument. So we can do integer arithmetic.\n\n However, we must use the same integer arithmetic as tl.cdiv. We can do:\n\n   num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n This is safe.\n\n Steps:\n\n   In the kernel, we will:\n\n      pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n      pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n      pid_spatial = tl.program_id(2)\n\n      num_d_blocks = (output_depth + BLOCK_D - 1) // BLOCK_D\n      num_h_blocks = (output_height + BLOCK_H - 1) // BLOCK_H\n      num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n      total_hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n      total_dhw_blocks = num_d_blocks * total_hw_blocks\n\n      # Since we have pid_spatial in [0, total_dhw_blocks), we can decompose:\n\n      d_block_idx = pid_spatial // total_hw_blocks\n      hw_remaining = pid_spatial % total_hw_blocks\n      h_block_idx = hw_remaining // num_w_blocks\n      w_block_idx = hw_remaining % num_w_blocks\n\n   Then the starting indices:\n\n      d0 = d_block_idx * BLOCK_D\n      h0 = h_block_idx * BLOCK_H\n      w0 = w_block_idx * BLOCK_W\n\n   Then proceed as before.\n\n But note: the autotuner uses the key ['output_depth', 'output_height', 'output_width'] for the configs. The block sizes (BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W) are compile-time constants. So we can compute the number of blocks per dimension.\n\n However, we must be cautious: the kernel must be efficient and avoid expensive operations. The above decomposition is just integer arithmetic and is cheap.\n\n Let's restructure the kernel accordingly.\n\n Also, we must adjust the grid function:\n\n   Currently, the grid function is:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            return (\n                x.size(0),  # batch size\n                self.out_channels,  # output channels\n                triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D']),\n                triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H']),\n                triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W']),\n            )\n\n   Now we want:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            d_blocks = triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D'])\n            h_blocks = triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H'])\n            w_blocks = triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W'])\n            num_spatial_blocks = d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks\n            return (x.size(0), self.out_channels, num_spatial_blocks)\n\n   This grid has 3 dimensions.\n\n We also remove the autotune key? The autotune key remains the same because we are still using the same dimensions.\n\n However, note: the autotuner uses the key to index the configs. The key is a list of argument names. We are still passing output_depth, output_height, output_width. So it's okay.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We will change the kernel to have 3 program_id dimensions.\n\n   We remove the old pid_d, pid_h, pid_w and replace with a single pid_spatial.\n\n   Then we compute the block indices as described.\n\n   We also change the grid function to return a 3-tuple.\n\n Let's write the kernel accordingly.\n\n Important: We must not change the kernel signature (parameter names) because the autotuner uses them.\n\n Steps in the kernel:\n\n   Replace the 5 program_id with 3.\n\n   Then compute:\n\n        pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n        pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n        pid_spatial = tl.program_id(2)\n\n        # Compute the number of blocks in each spatial dimension\n        num_d_blocks = (output_depth + BLOCK_D - 1) // BLOCK_D\n        num_h_blocks = (output_height + BLOCK_H - 1) // BLOCK_H\n        num_w_blocks = (output_width + BLOCK_W - 1) // BLOCK_W\n\n        total_hw_blocks = num_h_blocks * num_w_blocks\n        total_dhw_blocks = num_d_blocks * total_hw_blocks\n\n        # Check: pid_spatial should be in [0, total_dhw_blocks)\n        # Now decompose pid_spatial:\n        d_block_idx = pid_spatial // total_hw_blocks\n        hw_remaining = pid_spatial % total_hw_blocks\n        h_block_idx = hw_remaining // num_w_blocks\n        w_block_idx = hw_remaining % num_w_blocks\n\n        d0 = d_block_idx * BLOCK_D\n        h0 = h_block_idx * BLOCK_H\n        w0 = w_block_idx * BLOCK_W\n\n   Then the rest of the kernel remains the same.\n\n But note: the kernel uses the block starting indices (d0, h0, w0) and then loads a block of size (BLOCK_D, BLOCK_H, BLOCK_W). We must ensure that we don't go out of bounds, but we already have the mask.\n\n However, note: the number of blocks computed by the grid is the same as the total number of spatial blocks (d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks). So each block is covered.\n\n Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n Also, note: the kernel might have performance implications because we are doing integer division and modulus? But these are scalar operations and the dimensions are small (the number of blocks is not huge). So it should be acceptable.\n\n We will now rewrite the kernel to use 3 program_id dimensions.\n\n We must be cautious: the kernel must still be correct.\n\n We'll also update the grid function to return (batch_size, out_channels, d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks).\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Note: We are only changing the program_id handling and the grid function. The rest of the kernel remains the same.\n\n However, note: the kernel uses the original block_mask which uses the output dimensions to mask the block. That part remains unchanged.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n Also, note: the autotuner might have issues? The autotuner uses the key ['output_depth', 'output_height', 'output_width'] which are still passed. So it should be fine.\n\n We are going to change the kernel and the grid function.\n\n We'll replace the current kernel with the following:\n\n   We remove the 5 program_id axes and use 3.\n\n   Then compute the block indices as above.\n\n   The rest of the kernel is the same.\n\n We must also update the grid function in the host code.\n\n Let's write the new kernel and grid function.\n\n Important: We are only allowed to change the Triton kernel source within the EVOLVE-BLOCK. We must not change the surrounding code.\n\n We are going to change:\n\n   - The program_id handling\n   - The grid function\n\n But note: the current program has the grid function defined as:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            return (\n                x.size(0),  # batch size\n                self.out_channels,  # output channels\n                triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D']),\n                triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H']),\n                triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W']),\n            )\n\n We change it to:\n\n        def grid(meta):\n            d_blocks = triton.cdiv(D_out, meta['BLOCK_D'])\n            h_blocks = triton.cdiv(H_out, meta['BLOCK_H'])\n            w_blocks = triton.cdiv(W_out, meta['BLOCK_W'])\n            num_spatial_blocks = d_blocks * h_blocks * w_blocks\n            return (x.size(0), self.out_channels, num_spatial_blocks)\n\n Now we write the kernel accordingly.\n\n Let's update the kernel:\n\n   Remove the old pid_d, pid_h, pid_w and replace with pid_spatial.\n\n   Then compute the block indices as described.\n\n We'll also remove the old comments and restructure accordingly.\n\n We must be cautious: the kernel must not break the constraints (e.g., boundary checks, masks).\n\n We are going to output the entire code block for the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n Since we are only allowed to output the code block, we will write the entire ModelNew class with the updated kernel and grid function.\n\n However, note: the problem says \"Modify ONLY the Triton kernel source within this block - all other code is LOCKED.\" But we are also changing the grid function which is in the host code? Actually, the grid function is inside the method `triton_conv_forward`. We are allowed to change it because it's part of the Triton kernel launch.\n\n But note: the instructions say \"all other code is LOCKED\" meaning we cannot change the class structure, the forward method, etc. However, the grid function is part of the kernel launch and is essential for the kernel.\n\n We are going to change:\n\n   - The kernel definition (to use 3 program_id dimensions and the new index computation)\n   - The grid function (to return 3 dimensions)\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n</think>\nTo address the compilation error caused by exceeding Triton's maximum program_id dimensions (only 0, 1, and 2 are allowed), we need to restructure the kernel to use only 3 dimensions. The solution involves:\n\n1. Combining the spatial dimensions (d, h, w) into a single program_id dimension\n2. Calculating spatial block indices using integer arithmetic\n3. Maintaining all performance optimizations (blocking, masking, etc.)\n\nHere's the complete solution:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, divisor, pool_size, bias_shape, sum_dim):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.in_channels = in_channels\n        self.out_channels = out_channels\n        self.kernel_size = kernel_size\n        self.divisor = divisor\n        self.pool_size = pool_size\n        self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(bias_shape))\n        self.sum_dim = sum_dim\n        \n        # Initialize convolution weights\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(out_channels, in_channels, *kernel_size))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Use Triton for fused convolution and division\n        x = self.triton_conv_forward(x, self.weight, self.divisor)\n        \n        # Continue with PyTorch for remaining operations\n        x = nn.functional.max_pool3d(x, self.pool_size)\n        x = nn.functional.adaptive_avg_pool3d(x, (1, 1, 1))\n        x = x + self.bias\n        x = torch.sum(x, dim=self.sum_dim)\n        return x\n\n    @staticmethod\n    @triton.autotune(\n        configs=[\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_D': 4, 'BLOCK_H': 16, 'BLOCK_W': 16}, num_warps=4),\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_D': 4, 'BLOCK_H': 16, 'BLOCK_W': 16}, num_warps=8),\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_D': 4, 'BLOCK_H': 32, 'BLOCK_W': 16}, num_warps=4),\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_D': 4, 'BLOCK_H': 32, 'BLOCK_W': 16}, num_warps=8),\n        ],\n        key=['output_depth', 'output_height', 'output_width'],\n    )\n    @triton.jit\n    def _conv3d_forward_kernel(\n        x_ptr, weight_ptr, output_ptr,\n        # Tensor dimensions\n        batch_size, in_channels, input_depth, input_height, input_width,\n        out_channels, kernel_depth, kernel_height, kernel_width,\n        output_depth, output_height, output_width,\n        stride_d, stride_h, stride_w,\n        padding_d, padding_h, padding_w,\n        divisor,\n        # Strides\n        x_batch_stride, x_channel_stride, x_d_stride, x_h_stride, x_w_stride,\n        weight_oc_stride, weight_ic_stride, weight_d_stride, weight_h_stride, weight_w_stride,\n        output_batch_stride, output_oc_stride, output_d_stride, output_h_stride, output_w_stride,\n        BLOCK_D: tl.constexpr, BLOCK_H: tl.constexpr, BLOCK_W: tl.constexpr,\n    ):\n        # Combine spatial dimensions into single program ID\n        pid_batch = tl.program_id(0)\n        pid_oc = tl.program_id(1)\n        pid_spatial = tl.program_id(2)\n        \n        # Calculate number of blocks per dimension\n        num_d_blocks = (output_depth + BLOCK_D -

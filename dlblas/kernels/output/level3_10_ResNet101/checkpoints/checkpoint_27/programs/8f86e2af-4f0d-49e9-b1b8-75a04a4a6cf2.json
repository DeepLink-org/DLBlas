{"id": "8f86e2af-4f0d-49e9-b1b8-75a04a4a6cf2", "code": "<think>\nWe are facing an OutOfResources error due to shared memory usage.\n The error message says: \"Required: 393216, Hardware limit: 232448\"\n We are using BLOCK_SIZE_C=32 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16, which leads to:\n   shared memory = (in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW) * (dtype) + ... \n However, the main issue is the dot product: we are loading a block of input of size [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] and a block of weights of size [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels].\n The dot product requires storing these in shared memory? Actually, Triton might use registers, but the problem is the total shared memory used by the kernel.\n\n Let's compute the shared memory usage per block:\n The kernel uses:\n   - Input block: (in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW) elements (each float32: 4 bytes)\n   - Weight block: (BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels) elements\n   - Other variables (like accumulators) are negligible.\n\n For the first bottleneck in ResNet101, in_channels=64, out_channels=64 (for the first conv1 in the bottleneck).\n So, input block: 64 * 16 = 1024 elements * 4 bytes = 4096 bytes.\n Weight block: 32 * 64 = 2048 elements * 4 bytes = 8192 bytes.\n Total: 4096 + 8192 = 12288 bytes, which is 12KB. Why does it report 393216 bytes (which is 384 KB)? \n\n Actually, the error might be due to the entire kernel using too much shared memory because of the way we are tiling and the number of threads per block.\n\n Alternatively, note that the kernel is launched with 3D grid: (batch, hw_blocks, c_blocks). Each block is a Triton program instance. The shared memory is per block (i.e., per program instance). The error says we are using 393216 bytes (about 384KB) and the limit is 232448 bytes (about 227KB). \n\n How is Triton allocating shared memory? The kernel does not declare any shared memory explicitly. The error might be from the temporary storage for the dot product. Triton might be using shared memory for the dot product. The dot product of [32,64] and [64,16] would require 32*16 = 512 accumulators (each 4 bytes) and then we have the input and weight blocks? That still doesn't add up to 384KB.\n\n Alternatively, note that the kernel is launched with a 3D grid, but the number of threads per block in CUDA terms is determined by Triton. The error might be from the entire kernel's shared memory usage per SM.\n\n However, the error message says: \"Reducing block sizes or `num_stages` may help.\"\n\n We have two options:\n  1. Reduce the block sizes (BLOCK_SIZE_C and BLOCK_SIZE_HW) to reduce shared memory usage.\n  2. Reduce the number of stages in the kernel (by using the `num_stages` option in the triton.jit decorator).\n\n Since we are using the default `num_stages` (which is 3 or 4) and the error says to reduce block sizes, we should try to reduce the block sizes.\n\n In the current program, we are using BLOCK_SIZE_C=32 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16. Let's reduce them to 16 and 8 respectively.\n\n Alternatively, we can use autotuning and let Triton choose the best configuration, but we must also ensure that the shared memory does not exceed the limit.\n\n However, note that the error message in the current program says that the kernel requires 393216 bytes. We must reduce the shared memory usage by a factor of about 393216/232448 \u2248 1.7, so roughly by half.\n\n How about we set:\n   BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n   BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n Then the input block: in_channels * 8 = 64*8=512 elements (2048 bytes)\n Weight block: 16 * 64 = 1024 elements (4096 bytes)\n Total: 2048+4096 = 6144 bytes (6KB) which is well below the limit.\n\n But note: the error might be due to the entire kernel's shared memory usage including temporary buffers for the dot product. The exact calculation is complex.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to set `num_stages=1` to reduce the shared memory usage per stage.\n\n However, the previous attempts that used BLOCK_SIZE_C=16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16 (like Program 2) still failed with 262144 bytes (256KB) required. So we must go even lower.\n\n Let me try to compute the shared memory for the dot product in Triton:\n\n The dot product of a [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels] and [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] matrix requires:\n   - Storing the first matrix: BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels * 4 bytes\n   - Storing the second matrix: in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW * 4 bytes\n   - The output matrix: BLOCK_SIZE_C * BLOCK_SIZE_HW * 4 bytes (but this is in registers, not shared memory).\n\n However, Triton might use shared memory to cache tiles of these matrices. The shared memory usage per block (in the CUDA sense) might be:\n\n   (BLOCK_SIZE_C * BLOCK_K + BLOCK_K * BLOCK_SIZE_HW) * 4 bytes\n\n where BLOCK_K is the tiling factor for K (in_channels). But Triton's dot product might use a fixed BLOCK_K (like 32) or it might be set to the entire in_channels? \n\n Actually, in our kernel, we are not tiling the in_channels dimension in the dot product. We are loading the entire in_channels at once. So the entire input and weight blocks must be in shared memory? That would be:\n\n   in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW * 4 (for input) + BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels * 4 (for weight)\n\n For in_channels=64, BLOCK_SIZE_C=32, BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16: \n   64*16*4 = 4096\n   32*64*4 = 8192\n   Total: 12288 (12KB) -> but the error says 393216 bytes (384KB) which is 32 times more? \n\n This suggests that the shared memory is being used for something else, or the entire kernel is using more than we think.\n\n Alternatively, note that the kernel might be launched with a 3D grid and each block (Triton program) might be assigned to a CUDA block. The shared memory per CUDA block might be the sum of the two matrices? But 12KB is acceptable.\n\n Another possibility: the error is from a different kernel (like the one in layer4) where in_channels is 512? Let's check:\n\n In layer4, the first bottleneck has in_channels=1024 (because of expansion factor 4, and the previous layer output 256*4=1024) and out_channels=512 (for conv1). Then:\n\n   Input block: 1024 * 16 * 4 = 65536 bytes\n   Weight block: 32 * 1024 * 4 = 131072 bytes\n   Total: 65536 + 131072 = 196608 bytes (192KB) which is still below the 227KB limit? \n\n But wait, the error says 393216 bytes. That is 192KB * 2 = 384KB? Maybe Triton uses two buffers? Or we have two stages? \n\n The error message says: \"Required: 393216\", which is 384KB. That is exactly twice 192KB. So if we have two stages, then we would need 192KB * 2 = 384KB, which exceeds the 227KB limit.\n\n Therefore, we must reduce the block sizes for the layers with large in_channels.\n\n How about we make the block sizes adaptive? But the kernel is compiled for specific block sizes.\n\n Alternatively, we can reduce the block sizes for all layers to a safe value.\n\n Let me compute for the worst-case layer (layer4, in_channels=1024) with BLOCK_SIZE_C=16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8:\n\n   Input block: 1024 * 8 * 4 = 32768 bytes\n   Weight block: 16 * 1024 * 4 = 65536 bytes\n   Total: 32768+65536 = 98304 bytes (96KB). With two stages: 196608 bytes (192KB) which is below 227KB.\n\n So we can set:\n   BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n   BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n We'll change the kernel launch to use these block sizes.\n\n Also, note that the grid calculation in the forward pass of Bottleneck uses the same block sizes. We must change the grid calculation to use the new block sizes? Actually, the grid calculation uses the block sizes we pass as arguments to the kernel. But in the current program, we are passing 32 and 16. We will change that to 16 and 8.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. In the Bottleneck.forward, change the kernel launch parameters to:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n    and then set the grid accordingly:\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + BLOCK_SIZE_C - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_C\n\n    and then pass these block sizes to the kernel.\n\n 2. We must also change the kernel to use these block sizes. The kernel is already parameterized.\n\n But note: the kernel uses the block sizes as constexpr, so it is compiled for the specific values we pass. We are passing 16 and 8.\n\n However, the kernel was written for arbitrary block sizes, so it's safe.\n\n Let me update the code accordingly.\n\n Additionally, we can try to reduce the number of warps or stages? But we are not setting them. We can set `num_warps=4` and `num_stages=1` to be safe.\n\n Since the shared memory per stage is now 96KB, and we have 227KB, we can even do `num_stages=2` if needed for performance. But let's first make it run.\n\n We'll set:\n   num_warps=4\n   num_stages=1\n\n by adding the decorator:\n\n   @triton.jit(num_warps=4, num_stages=1)\n\n But note: the kernel might be slower. We can try without first and see if it compiles.\n\n However, the error was about shared memory, and we are reducing the block sizes. Let's try without changing num_warps and num_stages first.\n\n But to be safe, we can set num_stages=1 to avoid the doubling of shared memory for multiple stages.\n\n Alternatively, we can use autotuning to find a configuration that fits, but we are in a correctness phase.\n\n Given the above, we will:\n\n   - Reduce BLOCK_SIZE_C to 16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW to 8.\n   - Set num_stages=1 and num_warps=4 in the triton.jit decorator.\n\n We'll change the kernel as follows:\n\n   @triton.jit(num_warps=4, num_stages=1)\n\n and in the forward pass:\n\n        grid_batch = B\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + 8 - 1) // 8   # because BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + 16 - 1) // 16   # because BLOCK_SIZE_C=16\n\n        fused_conv_bn_relu_1x1[(grid_batch, grid_hw, grid_c)](\n            ...,\n            BLOCK_SIZE_C=16,\n            BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8,\n        )\n\n But note: the kernel uses the same variable names for the block sizes.\n\n Alternatively, we can define the block sizes as variables in the forward pass and use them in the grid and kernel.\n\n However, the current program uses hard-coded 32 and 16 in the kernel call. We'll change them to 16 and 8.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the kernel might not be efficient with such small blocks. We can try to optimize later.\n\n We are currently at the stage of fixing the shared memory error.\n\n Let's rewrite the program accordingly.\n</think>\nI'll optimize the Triton kernel to resolve the shared memory issue by reducing the block sizes and adding tuning parameters.

OutOfResources error due to shared memory usage.\n The error message says: \"Required: 393216, Hardware limit: 232448\"\n We are using BLOCK_SIZE_C=32 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16, which leads to:\n   shared memory = (in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW) * (dtype) + ... \n However, the main issue is the dot product: we are loading a block of input of size [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] and a block of weights of size [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels].\n The dot product requires storing these in shared memory? Actually, Triton might use registers, but the problem is the total shared memory used by the kernel.\n\n Let's compute the shared memory usage per block:\n The kernel uses:\n   - Input block: (in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW) elements (each float32: 4 bytes)\n   - Weight block: (BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels) elements\n   - Other variables (like accumulators) are negligible.\n\n For the first bottleneck in ResNet101, in_channels=64, out_channels=64 (for the first conv1 in the bottleneck).\n So, input block: 64 * 16 = 1024 elements * 4 bytes = 4096 bytes.\n Weight block: 32 * 64 = 2048 elements * 4 bytes = 8192 bytes.\n Total: 4096 + 8192 = 12288 bytes, which is 12KB. Why does it report 393216 bytes (which is 384 KB)? \n\n Actually, the error might be due to the entire kernel using too much shared memory because of the way we are tiling and the number of threads per block.\n\n Alternatively, note that the kernel is launched with 3D grid: (batch, hw_blocks, c_blocks). Each block is a Triton program instance. The shared memory is per block (i.e., per program instance). The error says we are using 393216 bytes (about 384KB) and the limit is 232448 bytes (about 227KB). \n\n How is Triton allocating shared memory? The kernel does not declare any shared memory explicitly. The error might be from the temporary storage for the dot product. Triton might be using shared memory for the dot product. The dot product of [32,64] and [64,16] would require 32*16 = 512 accumulators (each 4 bytes) and then we have the input and weight blocks? That still doesn't add up to 384KB.\n\n Alternatively, note that the kernel is launched with a 3D grid, but the number of threads per block in CUDA terms is determined by Triton. The error might be from the entire kernel's shared memory usage per SM.\n\n However, the error message says: \"Reducing block sizes or `num_stages` may help.\"\n\n We have two options:\n  1. Reduce the block sizes (BLOCK_SIZE_C and BLOCK_SIZE_HW) to reduce shared memory usage.\n  2. Reduce the number of stages in the kernel (by using the `num_stages` option in the triton.jit decorator).\n\n Since we are using the default `num_stages` (which is 3 or 4) and the error says to reduce block sizes, we should try to reduce the block sizes.\n\n In the current program, we are using BLOCK_SIZE_C=32 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16. Let's reduce them to 16 and 8 respectively.\n\n Alternatively, we can use autotuning and let Triton choose the best configuration, but we must also ensure that the shared memory does not exceed the limit.\n\n However, note that the error message in the current program says that the kernel requires 393216 bytes. We must reduce the shared memory usage by a factor of about 393216/232448 \u2248 1.7, so roughly by half.\n\n How about we set:\n   BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n   BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n Then the input block: in_channels * 8 = 64*8=512 elements (2048 bytes)\n Weight block: 16 * 64 = 1024 elements (4096 bytes)\n Total: 2048+4096 = 6144 bytes (6KB) which is well below the limit.\n\n But note: the error might be due to the entire kernel's shared memory usage including temporary buffers for the dot product. The exact calculation is complex.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to set `num_stages=1` to reduce the shared memory usage per stage.\n\n However, the previous attempts that used BLOCK_SIZE_C=16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16 (like Program 2) still failed with 262144 bytes (256KB) required. So we must go even lower.\n\n Let me try to compute the shared memory for the dot product in Triton:\n\n The dot product of a [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels] and [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] matrix requires:\n   - Storing the first matrix: BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels * 4 bytes\n   - Storing the second matrix: in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW * 4 bytes\n   - The output matrix: BLOCK_SIZE_C * BLOCK_SIZE_HW * 4 bytes (but this is in registers, not shared memory).\n\n However, Triton might use shared memory to cache tiles of these matrices. The shared memory usage per block (in the CUDA sense) might be:\n\n   (BLOCK_SIZE_C * BLOCK_K + BLOCK_K * BLOCK_SIZE_HW) * 4 bytes\n\n where BLOCK_K is the tiling factor for K (in_channels). But Triton's dot product might use a fixed BLOCK_K (like 32) or it might be set to the entire in_channels? \n\n Actually, in our kernel, we are not tiling the in_channels dimension in the dot product. We are loading the entire in_channels at once. So the entire input and weight blocks must be in shared memory? That would be:\n\n   in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW * 4 (for input) + BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels * 4 (for weight)\n\n For in_channels=64, BLOCK_SIZE_C=32, BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16: \n   64*16*4 = 4096\n   32*64*4 = 8192\n   Total: 12288 (12KB) -> but the error says 393216 bytes (384KB) which is 32 times more? \n\n This suggests that the shared memory is being used for something else, or the entire kernel is using more than we think.\n\n Alternatively, note that the kernel might be launched with a 3D grid and each block (Triton program) might be assigned to a CUDA block. The shared memory per CUDA block might be the sum of the two matrices? But 12KB is acceptable.\n\n Another possibility: the error is from a different kernel (like the one in layer4) where in_channels is 512? Let's check:\n\n In layer4, the first bottleneck has in_channels=1024 (because of expansion factor 4, and the previous layer output 256*4=1024) and out_channels=512 (for conv1). Then:\n\n   Input block: 1024 * 16 * 4 = 65536 bytes\n   Weight block: 32 * 1024 * 4 = 131072 bytes\n   Total: 65536 + 131072 = 196608 bytes (192KB) which is still below the 227KB limit? \n\n But wait, the error says 393216 bytes. That is 192KB * 2 = 384KB? Maybe Triton uses two buffers? Or we have two stages? \n\n The error message says: \"Required: 393216\", which is 384KB. That is exactly twice 192KB. So if we have two stages, then we would need 192KB * 2 = 384KB, which exceeds the 227KB limit.\n\n Therefore, we must reduce the block sizes for the layers with large in_channels.\n\n How about we make the block sizes adaptive? But the kernel is compiled for specific block sizes.\n\n Alternatively, we can reduce the block sizes for all layers to a safe value.\n\n Let me compute for the worst-case layer (layer4, in_channels=1024) with BLOCK_SIZE_C=16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8:\n\n   Input block: 1024 * 8 * 4 = 32768 bytes\n   Weight block: 16 * 1024 * 4 = 65536 bytes\n   Total: 32768+65536 = 98304 bytes (96KB). With two stages: 196608 bytes (192KB) which is below 227KB.\n\n So we can set:\n   BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n   BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n We'll change the kernel launch to use these block sizes.\n\n Also, note that the grid calculation in the forward pass of Bottleneck uses the same block sizes. We must change the grid calculation to use the new block sizes? Actually, the grid calculation uses the block sizes we pass as arguments to the kernel. But in the current program, we are passing 32 and 16. We will change that to 16 and 8.\n\n Steps:\n\n 1. In the Bottleneck.forward, change the kernel launch parameters to:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n    and then set the grid accordingly:\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + BLOCK_SIZE_C - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_C\n\n    and then pass these block sizes to the kernel.\n\n 2. We must also change the kernel to use these block sizes. The kernel is already parameterized.\n\n But note: the kernel uses the block sizes as constexpr, so it is compiled for the specific values we pass. We are passing 16 and 8.\n\n However, the kernel was written for arbitrary block sizes, so it's safe.\n\n Let me update the code accordingly.\n\n Additionally, we can try to reduce the number of warps or stages? But we are not setting them. We can set `num_warps=4` and `num_stages=1` to be safe.\n\n Since the shared memory per stage is now 96KB, and we have 227KB, we can even do `num_stages=2` if needed for performance. But let's first make it run.\n\n We'll set:\n   num_warps=4\n   num_stages=1\n\n by adding the decorator:\n\n   @triton.jit(num_warps=4, num_stages=1)\n\n But note: the kernel might be slower. We can try without first and see if it compiles.\n\n However, the error was about shared memory, and we are reducing the block sizes. Let's try without changing num_warps and num_stages first.\n\n But to be safe, we can set num_stages=1 to avoid the doubling of shared memory for multiple stages.\n\n Alternatively, we can use autotuning to find a configuration that fits, but we are in a correctness phase.\n\n Given the above, we will:\n\n   - Reduce BLOCK_SIZE_C to 16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW to 8.\n   - Set num_stages=1 and num_warps=4 in the triton.jit decorator.\n\n We'll change the kernel as follows:\n\n   @triton.jit(num_warps=4, num_stages=1)\n\n and in the forward pass:\n\n        grid_batch = B\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + 8 - 1) // 8   # because BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + 16 - 1) // 16   # because BLOCK_SIZE_C=16\n\n        fused_conv_bn_relu_1x1[(grid_batch, grid_hw, grid_c)](\n            ...,\n            BLOCK_SIZE_C=16,\n            BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8,\n        )\n\n But note: the kernel uses the same variable names for the block sizes.\n\n Alternatively, we can define the block sizes as variables in the forward pass and use them in the grid and kernel.\n\n However, the current program uses hard-coded 32 and 16 in the kernel call. We'll change them to 16 and 8.\n\n Let me write the code accordingly.\n\n But note: the kernel might not be efficient with such small blocks. We can try to optimize later.\n\n We are currently at the stage of fixing the shared memory error.\n\n Let's rewrite the program accordingly.\n</think>\nI'll optimize the Triton kernel to resolve the shared memory issue by reducing the block sizes and adding tuning parameters. The key changes are:\n1. Reduced BLOCK_SIZE"]}}}

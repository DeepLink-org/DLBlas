{"id": "7aaeeea5-5375-4443-abd2-19eaf4edf8a3", "code": "<think>\nWe are facing an OutOfResources error due to shared memory usage in the Triton kernel.\n The error message: \"out of resource: shared memory, Required: 393216, Hardware limit: 232448\"\n\n The kernel uses a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE_C, BLOCK_SIZE_HW) = (32, 16) for the output channels and spatial dimensions.\n The input is of size (in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW) and weights are (BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels).\n The convolution is computed by a dot product of the weight block and the input block.\n\n The shared memory usage is likely due to the input and weight matrices being stored in shared memory for the dot product.\n\n We note that the current kernel does not use shared memory explicitly, but Triton might be using shared memory for the dot product.\n\n However, the error indicates that the required shared memory (393216 bytes) exceeds the hardware limit (232448 bytes).\n\n Let's estimate the shared memory usage:\n\n In the kernel, we are loading:\n   - Input matrix: [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] ->  in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW elements\n   - Weight matrix: [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels] -> BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels elements\n\n For ResNet, the first bottleneck layer has in_channels=64, out_channels=64.\n So, for a block of (32,16) we would have:\n   Input: 64 * 16 = 1024 elements\n   Weight: 32 * 64 = 2048 elements\n   Total elements: 1024 + 2048 = 3072\n\n Each element is float32 (4 bytes) -> 3072 * 4 = 12288 bytes.\n\n This is well below the shared memory limit. So why are we getting 393216 bytes?\n\n Alternatively, the error might be due to the entire tensor being stored in shared memory? That seems unlikely.\n\n Another possibility is that the kernel is using shared memory for intermediate results and the total shared memory per block is too high.\n\n However, 393216 bytes is 393216 / 4 = 98304 floats. That is a lot.\n\n Alternatively, the error might be because the kernel is using too many registers and the shared memory is being used for spilling? \n\n Given the complexity, we try to reduce the block sizes to see if it helps.\n\n We note that in the previous attempts, reducing the block sizes to 16x16 helped in one case (but then required 262144 which is still too high).\n\n Alternatively, we can try to reduce the block size for the channel dimension (BLOCK_SIZE_C) and the spatial dimension (BLOCK_SIZE_HW) to 16 and 8 respectively.\n\n However, we also note that the kernel uses a 2D grid and the block for the spatial dimension is over the entire hw_size (H*W). We are loading BLOCK_SIZE_HW elements per block.\n\n Another idea: the error might be because the kernel is using shared memory for the entire input block and weight block, and the combined size is too big when the in_channels is large? But in the first layer, in_channels is 64.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be in a different layer? The error occurred in layer4, which has in_channels=512 * expansion (2048) and out_channels=512.\n\n For the kernel in the bottleneck of layer4:\n   in_channels = 2048, out_channels=512, and hw_size = 14*14 = 196.\n\n Using block sizes (32,16):\n   Input: 2048 * 16 = 32768 elements -> 32768 * 4 = 131072 bytes\n   Weights: 32 * 2048 = 65536 elements -> 65536 * 4 = 262144 bytes\n   Total: 131072 + 262144 = 393216 bytes -> which matches the error.\n\n So, the problem is that the kernel is storing the entire weight block and input block in shared memory? And that exceeds the limit.\n\n We need to reduce the shared memory usage.\n\n How can we do that?\n 1. Reduce the block sizes. For example, use BLOCK_SIZE_C=16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8. Then:\n      Input: 2048 * 8 = 16384 elements -> 65536 bytes\n      Weights: 16 * 2048 = 32768 elements -> 131072 bytes\n      Total: 65536 + 131072 = 196608 bytes -> still above 232448? (196608 is less than 232448? Actually 196608 < 232448 -> 196608/1024=192 KB, 232448/1024=227 KB -> so it fits).\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can split the dot product into chunks and use a loop, so that we don't load the entire input and weight at once.\n\n However, the Triton dot operation already does tiling internally? But we are loading the entire blocks.\n\n We might need to change the kernel to do tiling over the in_channels dimension.\n\n Since the in_channels dimension is large (2048), we can break it into multiple blocks.\n\n We can change the kernel to have an inner loop over chunks of the in_channels.\n\n Steps:\n   - Instead of loading the entire input and weight matrices, we load a tile at a time and accumulate the dot product.\n\n But note: the kernel currently uses `tl.dot` which expects the entire matrices. We would have to change the computation to do a tiled dot product.\n\n Alternatively, we can reduce the block sizes to 16 and 8 and see if that fits.\n\n Let's try reducing the block sizes in the kernel call for the layer4.\n\n However, note that the kernel parameters BLOCK_SIZE_C and BLOCK_SIZE_HW are passed as compile-time constants. We are currently passing 32 and 16.\n\n We can make the block sizes smaller for the layers that have large in_channels.\n\n But the kernel is used in every bottleneck block. We cannot have different block sizes for different layers? Actually, we can pass them as parameters and the kernel will be recompiled for each configuration.\n\n However, the autotuner might help, but we don't have it in the current kernel.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the block sizes to smaller values for all layers.\n\n We note that the error occurs in layer4, so we must fix that.\n\n Proposed change:\n   - Change the block sizes from (32,16) to (16,8) in the kernel launch.\n\n But note: in the Bottleneck.forward, we are currently setting:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 32\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 16\n\n We can change these to 16 and 8.\n\n However, the grid calculation uses BLOCK_SIZE_HW? Actually, in the current code, we are not using the passed BLOCK_SIZE_HW for grid calculation? Let me check:\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + 15) // 16   -> this is fixed to 16? But we are passing BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16.\n\n We are passing the block sizes as kernel parameters and also using them in the grid calculation.\n\n Actually, in the kernel launch, we are passing:\n        hw_size,\n        32,  # BLOCK_SIZE_C\n        16,  # BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n\n And the grid is calculated as:\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + 15) // 16   -> this uses 16 as the block size for hw.\n\n But note: the kernel expects the block size for hw as the parameter BLOCK_SIZE_HW. So we should use the same block size in the grid calculation.\n\n We are currently using a fixed 16 in the grid calculation. We should change that to use the variable BLOCK_SIZE_HW.\n\n However, in the current code, we are setting BLOCK_SIZE_HW to 16 in the launch, so it's consistent.\n\n But if we change the block sizes to 16 and 8, we must also change the grid calculation to use 8 for the spatial block.\n\n How about we do:\n\n   In the Bottleneck.forward, we define:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n   Then compute:\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n\n   And then pass these block sizes to the kernel.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the block sizes to 16 and 8 for all layers? That might be safe.\n\n But note: for the first layer, the in_channels is 64, which is manageable even with 32x16. However, we want to use the same kernel for all.\n\n We'll change the block sizes to 16 and 8 and adjust the grid accordingly.\n\n However, we must also change the kernel to use the new block sizes. The kernel is written to use the passed BLOCK_SIZE_C and BLOCK_SIZE_HW.\n\n So let's change in the Bottleneck.forward:\n\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + BLOCK_SIZE_C - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_C\n\n And then pass these block sizes to the kernel.\n\n We'll do that.\n\n Alternatively, we might try to use even smaller block sizes for the later layers? But we want a uniform solution.\n\n Let's change the block sizes to 16 and 8.\n\n Also, note that the kernel uses the block sizes in the masks and indexing.\n\n We hope that with these block sizes, the shared memory usage in the worst-case (layer4) would be:\n\n        Input: [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] = 2048 * 8 = 16384 elements -> 16384 * 4 = 65536 bytes\n        Weights: [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels] = 16 * 2048 = 32768 elements -> 32768 * 4 = 131072 bytes\n        Total: 65536 + 131072 = 196608 bytes, which is less than 232448 bytes.\n\n So it should fit.\n\n Let's rewrite the Bottleneck.forward accordingly.\n\n However, note that the kernel also uses shared memory for other variables? But the main matrices are the two.\n\n We'll change the block sizes to 16 and 8.\n\n We'll also fix the grid calculation to use the variable block sizes.\n\n Specifically, in the Bottleneck.forward:\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + BLOCK_SIZE_C - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_C\n\n And then set:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n We'll do this.\n\n But note: the kernel might have performance degradation with smaller blocks. However, we must first pass the resource check.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a larger block for the channel dimension and a smaller block for the spatial dimension? But the shared memory for weights is BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels, which is dominated by in_channels. So reducing BLOCK_SIZE_C helps.\n\n We'll change the block sizes to 16 and 8.\n\n Let's rewrite the current program accordingly.\n</think>\nBased on the analysis, the primary issue is an `OutOfResources` error due to excessive shared memory usage in the Triton kernel. The kernel is using 393216 bytes while the hardware limit is 232448 bytes. This occurs in layer4 where input channels are large (2048). \n\nThe solution involves:\n1. Reducing block sizes to decrease shared memory usage\n2. Using dynamic grid calculation based on block sizes\n3. Maintaining correct masking and memory access patterns\n\nHere's the optimized implementation:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn

"responses": ["<think>\nWe are facing an OutOfResources error due to shared memory usage in the Triton kernel.\n The error message: \"out of resource: shared memory, Required: 393216, Hardware limit: 232448\"\n\n The kernel uses a block of size (BLOCK_SIZE_C, BLOCK_SIZE_HW) = (32, 16) for the output channels and spatial dimensions.\n The input is of size (in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW) and weights are (BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels).\n The convolution is computed by a dot product of the weight block and the input block.\n\n The shared memory usage is likely due to the input and weight matrices being stored in shared memory for the dot product.\n\n We note that the current kernel does not use shared memory explicitly, but Triton might be using shared memory for the dot product.\n\n However, the error indicates that the required shared memory (393216 bytes) exceeds the hardware limit (232448 bytes).\n\n Let's estimate the shared memory usage:\n\n In the kernel, we are loading:\n   - Input matrix: [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] ->  in_channels * BLOCK_SIZE_HW elements\n   - Weight matrix: [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels] -> BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels elements\n\n For ResNet, the first bottleneck layer has in_channels=64, out_channels=64.\n So, for a block of (32,16) we would have:\n   Input: 64 * 16 = 1024 elements\n   Weight: 32 * 64 = 2048 elements\n   Total elements: 1024 + 2048 = 3072\n\n Each element is float32 (4 bytes) -> 3072 * 4 = 12288 bytes.\n\n This is well below the shared memory limit. So why are we getting 393216 bytes?\n\n Alternatively, the error might be due to the entire tensor being stored in shared memory? That seems unlikely.\n\n Another possibility is that the kernel is using shared memory for intermediate results and the total shared memory per block is too high.\n\n However, 393216 bytes is 393216 / 4 = 98304 floats. That is a lot.\n\n Alternatively, the error might be because the kernel is using too many registers and the shared memory is being used for spilling? \n\n Given the complexity, we try to reduce the block sizes to see if it helps.\n\n We note that in the previous attempts, reducing the block sizes to 16x16 helped in one case (but then required 262144 which is still too high).\n\n Alternatively, we can try to reduce the block size for the channel dimension (BLOCK_SIZE_C) and the spatial dimension (BLOCK_SIZE_HW) to 16 and 8 respectively.\n\n However, we also note that the kernel uses a 2D grid and the block for the spatial dimension is over the entire hw_size (H*W). We are loading BLOCK_SIZE_HW elements per block.\n\n Another idea: the error might be because the kernel is using shared memory for the entire input block and weight block, and the combined size is too big when the in_channels is large? But in the first layer, in_channels is 64.\n\n Alternatively, the problem might be in a different layer? The error occurred in layer4, which has in_channels=512 * expansion (2048) and out_channels=512.\n\n For the kernel in the bottleneck of layer4:\n   in_channels = 2048, out_channels=512, and hw_size = 14*14 = 196.\n\n Using block sizes (32,16):\n   Input: 2048 * 16 = 32768 elements -> 32768 * 4 = 131072 bytes\n   Weights: 32 * 2048 = 65536 elements -> 65536 * 4 = 262144 bytes\n   Total: 131072 + 262144 = 393216 bytes -> which matches the error.\n\n So, the problem is that the kernel is storing the entire weight block and input block in shared memory? And that exceeds the limit.\n\n We need to reduce the shared memory usage.\n\n How can we do that?\n 1. Reduce the block sizes. For example, use BLOCK_SIZE_C=16 and BLOCK_SIZE_HW=8. Then:\n      Input: 2048 * 8 = 16384 elements -> 65536 bytes\n      Weights: 16 * 2048 = 32768 elements -> 131072 bytes\n      Total: 65536 + 131072 = 196608 bytes -> still above 232448? (196608 is less than 232448? Actually 196608 < 232448 -> 196608/1024=192 KB, 232448/1024=227 KB -> so it fits).\n\n 2. Alternatively, we can split the dot product into chunks and use a loop, so that we don't load the entire input and weight at once.\n\n However, the Triton dot operation already does tiling internally? But we are loading the entire blocks.\n\n We might need to change the kernel to do tiling over the in_channels dimension.\n\n Since the in_channels dimension is large (2048), we can break it into multiple blocks.\n\n We can change the kernel to have an inner loop over chunks of the in_channels.\n\n Steps:\n   - Instead of loading the entire input and weight matrices, we load a tile at a time and accumulate the dot product.\n\n But note: the kernel currently uses `tl.dot` which expects the entire matrices. We would have to change the computation to do a tiled dot product.\n\n Alternatively, we can reduce the block sizes to 16 and 8 and see if that fits.\n\n Let's try reducing the block sizes in the kernel call for the layer4.\n\n However, note that the kernel parameters BLOCK_SIZE_C and BLOCK_SIZE_HW are passed as compile-time constants. We are currently passing 32 and 16.\n\n We can make the block sizes smaller for the layers that have large in_channels.\n\n But the kernel is used in every bottleneck block. We cannot have different block sizes for different layers? Actually, we can pass them as parameters and the kernel will be recompiled for each configuration.\n\n However, the autotuner might help, but we don't have it in the current kernel.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the block sizes to smaller values for all layers.\n\n We note that the error occurs in layer4, so we must fix that.\n\n Proposed change:\n   - Change the block sizes from (32,16) to (16,8) in the kernel launch.\n\n But note: in the Bottleneck.forward, we are currently setting:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 32\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 16\n\n We can change these to 16 and 8.\n\n However, the grid calculation uses BLOCK_SIZE_HW? Actually, in the current code, we are not using the passed BLOCK_SIZE_HW for grid calculation? Let me check:\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + 15) // 16   -> this is fixed to 16? But we are passing BLOCK_SIZE_HW=16.\n\n We are passing the block sizes as kernel parameters and also using them in the grid calculation.\n\n Actually, in the kernel launch, we are passing:\n        hw_size,\n        32,  # BLOCK_SIZE_C\n        16,  # BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n\n And the grid is calculated as:\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + 15) // 16   -> this uses 16 as the block size for hw.\n\n But note: the kernel expects the block size for hw as the parameter BLOCK_SIZE_HW. So we should use the same block size in the grid calculation.\n\n We are currently using a fixed 16 in the grid calculation. We should change that to use the variable BLOCK_SIZE_HW.\n\n However, in the current code, we are setting BLOCK_SIZE_HW to 16 in the launch, so it's consistent.\n\n But if we change the block sizes to 16 and 8, we must also change the grid calculation to use 8 for the spatial block.\n\n How about we do:\n\n   In the Bottleneck.forward, we define:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n   Then compute:\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n\n   And then pass these block sizes to the kernel.\n\n Alternatively, we can set the block sizes to 16 and 8 for all layers? That might be safe.\n\n But note: for the first layer, the in_channels is 64, which is manageable even with 32x16. However, we want to use the same kernel for all.\n\n We'll change the block sizes to 16 and 8 and adjust the grid accordingly.\n\n However, we must also change the kernel to use the new block sizes. The kernel is written to use the passed BLOCK_SIZE_C and BLOCK_SIZE_HW.\n\n So let's change in the Bottleneck.forward:\n\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + BLOCK_SIZE_C - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_C\n\n And then pass these block sizes to the kernel.\n\n We'll do that.\n\n Alternatively, we might try to use even smaller block sizes for the later layers? But we want a uniform solution.\n\n Let's change the block sizes to 16 and 8.\n\n Also, note that the kernel uses the block sizes in the masks and indexing.\n\n We hope that with these block sizes, the shared memory usage in the worst-case (layer4) would be:\n\n        Input: [in_channels, BLOCK_SIZE_HW] = 2048 * 8 = 16384 elements -> 16384 * 4 = 65536 bytes\n        Weights: [BLOCK_SIZE_C, in_channels] = 16 * 2048 = 32768 elements -> 32768 * 4 = 131072 bytes\n        Total: 65536 + 131072 = 196608 bytes, which is less than 232448 bytes.\n\n So it should fit.\n\n Let's rewrite the Bottleneck.forward accordingly.\n\n However, note that the kernel also uses shared memory for other variables? But the main matrices are the two.\n\n We'll change the block sizes to 16 and 8.\n\n We'll also fix the grid calculation to use the variable block sizes.\n\n Specifically, in the Bottleneck.forward:\n\n        grid_hw = (hw_size + BLOCK_SIZE_HW - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n        grid_c = (self.out_channels + BLOCK_SIZE_C - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE_C\n\n And then set:\n        BLOCK_SIZE_C = 16\n        BLOCK_SIZE_HW = 8\n\n We'll do this.\n\n But note: the kernel might have performance degradation with smaller blocks. However, we must first pass the resource check.\n\n Alternatively, we can try to use a larger block for the channel dimension and a smaller block for the spatial dimension? But the shared memory for weights is BLOCK_SIZE_C * in_channels, which is dominated by in_channels. So reducing BLOCK_SIZE_C helps.\n\n We'll change the block sizes to 16 and 8.\n\n Let's rewrite the current program accordingly.\n</think>\nBased on the analysis, the primary issue is an `OutOfResources` error due to excessive shared memory usage in the Triton kernel. The kernel is using 393216 bytes while the hardware limit is 232448 bytes. This occurs in layer4 where input channels are large (2048). \n\nThe solution involves:\n1. Reducing block sizes to decrease shared memory usage\n2. Using dynamic grid calculation based on block sizes\n3. Maintaining correct masking and memory access patterns\n\nHere's the optimized implementation:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\nimport math\n\n@triton.jit\ndef fused_conv_bn_relu_1x1(\n    x_ptr, \n    w_ptr, \n    bn_weight_ptr, \n    bn_bias_ptr, \n    bn_mean_ptr, \n    bn_var_ptr, \n    output_ptr,\n    eps: tl.constexpr,\n    in_channels: tl.constexpr,\n    out_channels: tl.constexpr,\n    hw_size: tl.constexpr,\n    BLOCK_SIZE_C: tl.constexpr,\n    BLOCK_SIZE_HW: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    # Get program IDs\n    pid_batch = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n    pid_hw = tl.program_id(axis=1)\n    pid_c = tl.program_id(axis=2)\n    \n    # Calculate starting positions\n    hw_start = pid_hw * BLOCK_SIZE_HW\n    c_offsets = pid_c * BLOCK_SIZE_C + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_C)\n    \n    # Create masks\n    c_mask = c_offsets < out_channels\n    hw_indices = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE_HW)\n    hw_mask = (hw_start + hw_indices) < hw_size\n    \n    # Calculate input base offset\n    x_batch_offset = pid_batch * in_channels * hw_size\n    x_ptrs = x_ptr + x_batch_offset + tl.arange(0, in_channels)[:, None] * hw_size + hw_start + hw_indices[None, :]\n    \n    # Load input with masking\n    x = tl.load(x_ptrs, \n                mask=(tl.arange(0, in_channels)[:, None] < in_channels) & hw_mask[None, :], \n                other=0.0)\n    \n    # Load weights\n    w_ptrs = w_ptr + c_offsets[:, None] * in_channels + tl.arange(0, in_channels)[None, :]\n    w = tl.load(w_ptrs, \n                mask=c_mask[:, None] & (tl.arange(0, in_channels)[None, :] < in_channels), \n                other=0.0)\n    \n    # Compute convolution\n    conv_out = tl.dot(w, x)\n    \n    # Load BN parameters\n    bn_weight = tl.load(bn_weight_ptr + c_offsets, mask=c_mask, other=0.0)\n    bn_bias = tl.load(bn_bias_ptr + c_offsets, mask=c_mask, other=0.0)\n    bn_mean = tl.load(bn_mean_ptr + c_offsets, mask=c_mask, other=0.0)\n    bn_var = tl.load(bn_var_ptr + c_offsets, mask=c_mask, other=0.0)\n    \n    # Apply BN\n    inv_std = 1.0 / tl.sqrt(bn_var + eps)\n    bn_out = (conv_out -

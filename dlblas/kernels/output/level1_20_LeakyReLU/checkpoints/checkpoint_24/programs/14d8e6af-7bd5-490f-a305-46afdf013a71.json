The current implementation uses the PyTorch built-in function.\n However, we are to rewrite it in Triton for better performance.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the current implementation is in PyTorch and we are to replace it with a Triton kernel.\n 2. The LeakyReLU function: \n        output = x if x >= 0, else negative_slope * x\n 3. We can write a Triton kernel that applies this element-wise operation.\n\n Important:\n  - We must maintain the same input and output.\n  - We are allowed to change the internal implementation (forward pass) to use Triton.\n\n Approach:\n  - We will write a Triton kernel that takes the input tensor and the negative_slope as arguments.\n  - We will launch one program per element? Actually, we can use a grid that covers the entire tensor.\n    Since the operation is element-wise, we can have each program handle a contiguous block of elements.\n\n Constraints on the Triton kernel:\n  - The kernel must have a signature that we can call from the forward method.\n  - We must handle the tensor of arbitrary shape. We can flatten it for simplicity? But note: the input in the test is (batch_size, dim) = (16, 16384).\n  - We can compute the total number of elements and then have a 1D grid.\n\n Kernel design:\n  - We will have a kernel that uses:\n        pid = program_id(0)   # which block we are in\n        block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n        offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < n_elements\n\n  - We load the data at these offsets (if within mask).\n  - We compute: \n        result = tl.where(x >= 0, x, negative_slope * x)\n  - We store the result.\n\n  - We must set the grid appropriately: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE),)\n\n  - We also note that we are using the same negative_slope for all.\n\n  - We need to pass the negative_slope as a kernel argument.\n\n  - We also note that the input tensor might be non-contiguous? But in the forward we can make it contiguous.\n\n  - However, the problem says: \"NEVER change grid configuration, output tensor shapes, or PID logic\". \n    But note: the current grid configuration is not defined because we are replacing the PyTorch code.\n\n  - We are replacing the entire forward method with a Triton kernel call.\n\n  - We must also set the output tensor to have the same shape as input.\n\n Implementation:\n\n  In the forward method of ModelNew:\n      - Flatten the input to 1D? But we have to return the same shape. We can do:\n            output = torch.empty_like(x)\n            n_elements = x.numel()\n            grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n            _leaky_relu_kernel[grid](x, output, n_elements, self.negative_slope, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)\n\n      - Then return output after reshaping? Actually, we can just have the kernel write to a tensor of the same shape.\n\n      - But note: the input tensor is 2D (batch_size, dim). We can flatten it for the kernel and then reshape the output?\n\n      - Alternatively, we can have the kernel work on the original shape? It's easier to flatten because then we have 1D.\n\n  Let's flatten the tensor for simplicity. We will:\n        x_flat = x.contiguous().view(-1)\n        output_flat = torch.empty_like(x_flat)\n        ... kernel call on the flattened tensors ...\n        return output_flat.view_as(x)\n\n  But note: the problem says \"NEVER change ... output tensor shapes\". So we must return the same shape.\n\n  We can also avoid flattening by having the kernel handle arbitrary strides? That would be more complex. \n  Since the operation is element-wise, we can use the same 1D indexing regardless of the original shape.\n\n  Steps in forward:\n        x_cont = x.contiguous()   # to ensure contiguous, but note: the input might be contiguous already? We can make it safe.\n        output = torch.empty_like(x_cont)\n        n_elements = x_cont.numel()\n        grid = (triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE),)\n        _leaky_relu_kernel[grid](x_cont, output, n_elements, self.negative_slope, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n        return output\n\n  However, note: the original function returns the same shape. We are preserving the shape by using `empty_like` and then writing the same number of elements.\n\n  We must write the Triton kernel.\n\n  Kernel code:\n\n      @triton.jit\n      def _leaky_relu_kernel(x_ptr, output_ptr, n_elements, negative_slope, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n          pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n          block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n          offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n          mask = offsets < n_elements\n          x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n          # Compute LeakyReLU\n          zero = 0.0\n          # We can use: result = tl.where(x >= zero, x, x * negative_slope)\n          # But note: negative_slope is a scalar (float)\n          result = tl.where(x >= zero, x, x * negative_slope)\n          tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, result, mask=mask)\n\n  We must consider the data type? The kernel should work for float32 and float16? The problem says the input is torch.randn (float32) but in practice it might be others.\n\n  We can use the same kernel for multiple dtypes? Triton supports multiple dtypes by using the same code? But we are not using tensor cores.\n\n  Alternatively, we can specify the data type of the pointers? Actually, Triton will compile for the given data types.\n\n  We are not using any tensor core operations, so we don't need to align to 16x16. We can use any block size.\n\n  We can autotune the block size? The problem says we are allowed to do adaptive tuning. However, the example above does not use autotune. \n  We are only making one change so we can start with a fixed block size (say 1024) and then later we might autotune.\n\n  But note: the problem says we are allowed to do autotune. We can try to add autotune.\n\n  However, the problem also says: \"Small iterative steps: Modify \u226420 lines per revision\". We are already writing a kernel from scratch.\n\n  We are going to write the kernel without autotune first and then if we have time we can add autotune in the next step.\n\n  But note: the current program is very simple. We are replacing a built-in that is already optimized. \n  We must hope that our Triton kernel is faster? The built-in LeakyReLU in PyTorch is already very optimized (using CUDA kernel). \n  However, the problem requires a Triton implementation for the assignment.\n\n  We are going to write the Triton kernel and hope that it is at least as fast? We can try to use a large block size to be efficient.\n\n  We choose BLOCK_SIZE = 1024. We can also try 4096? But note that the tensor has 16*16384 = 262144 elements. \n  With 1024, we have 262144/1024 = 256 blocks.\n\n  We are going to write the kernel and the forward method accordingly.\n\n  Let's write the code.\n\n  We must import triton and triton.language.\n\n  We are going to change the ModelNew class to use the Triton kernel in forward.\n\n  We also note that the original program defines batch_size and dim and get_inputs. We must not change that because the problem says: \n      \"NEVER change grid configuration, output tensor shapes, or PID logic\"\n\n  But note: the grid configuration in the problem refers to the Triton kernel grid? We are defining it appropriately.\n\n  We are going to write:\n\n      import triton\n      import triton.language as tl\n\n      @triton.jit\n      def _leaky_relu_kernel(...): ...\n\n  Then in the forward method of ModelNew, we do the kernel launch.\n\n  Important: We must handle the case when n_elements is 0.\n\n  We are going to write the entire EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n  We are replacing the forward method and adding the kernel.\n\n  We must be cautious: the original ModelNew had a forward that called torch.nn.functional.leaky_relu. We are replacing that.\n\n  We are also adding the kernel function.\n\n  We are going to write:\n\n      # ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\n      import torch\n      import torch.nn as nn\n      import triton\n      import triton.language as tl\n\n      # Define the Triton kernel\n      @triton.jit\n      def _leaky_relu_kernel(x_ptr, output_ptr, n_elements, negative_slope, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n          pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n          block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n          offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n          mask = offsets < n_elements\n          x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n          # We'll compute the leaky ReLU\n          # Note: We can use tl.where with a condition\n          result = tl.where(x >= 0.0, x, x * negative_slope)\n          tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, result, mask=mask)\n\n      class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n          def __init__(self, negative_slope: float = 0.01):\n              super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n              self.negative_slope = negative_slope\n\n          def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n              # We want to apply the leaky relu element-wise\n              # Flatten the tensor to 1D for simplicity\n              x_cont = x.contiguous()\n              output = torch.empty_like(x_cont)\n              n_elements = x_cont.numel()\n\n              # If there are no elements, return output immediately\n              if n_elements == 0:\n                  return output\n\n              # We set the grid and block\n              # We choose a block size that is a power of two and at most the number of elements\n              BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n              grid = (triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE),)\n              _leaky_relu_kernel[grid](x_cont, output, n_elements, self.negative_slope, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n              return output\n\n      batch_size = 16\n      dim = 16384\n\n      def get_inputs():\n          x = torch.randn(batch_size, dim)\n          return [x]\n\n      def get_init_inputs():\n          return []  # No special initialization inputs needed\n      # =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n\n  However, note: the original program did not have triton imported. We are adding the imports inside the block.\n\n  We must be cautious: the entire block is replaced. We are including the imports.\n\n  But note: the surrounding environment might already have triton? The problem says that the evaluation pipeline runs Triton.\n\n  We are going to include the imports because the block is self-contained.\n\n  We are also using the same batch_size and dim as the original.\n\n  We hope this will compile and run correctly.\n\n  We are not using autotune yet. We can try to add autotune in a later step if we have time and if the performance is not satisfactory.\n\n  But note: the problem says we are allowed to do adaptive tuning. We might want to try different block sizes.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Small iterative steps: Modify \u226420 lines per revision\". We are already writing about 20 lines.\n\n  We are going to output the above code.\n\n  Let's write it.\n</think>\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef leaky_relu_kernel(\n    x_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    negative_slope,\n    n_elements,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = offsets < n_elements\n    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    \n    # Compute LeakyReLU efficiently\n    zero = 0.0\n    result = tl.where(x >= zero, x, x * negative_slope)\n    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, result, mask=mask)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, negative_slope: float = 0.01):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.negative_slope = negative_slope\n    \n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        x_cont = x.contiguous()\n        output = torch.empty_like(x_cont)\n        n_elements = x_cont.numel()\n        \n        if n_elements == 0:\n            return output\n            \n        # Optimal block size for element-wise operations\n        BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n        grid = (triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE),)\n        leaky_relu_kernel[grid](\n            x_cont, output, self.negative_slope, n_elements,\n            BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE\n        )\n        return output\n\nbatch_size = 16\ndim = 16384\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    x = torch.randn(batch_size, dim)\n    return [x]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []  # No special initialization inputs needed\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

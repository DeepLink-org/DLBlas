We want to rewrite it in Triton for performance.\n The original model uses torch.sigmoid which is efficient but we can try to write a Triton kernel for sigmoid and see if we can get speedup.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We will write a Triton kernel that computes the sigmoid function element-wise.\n 2. The sigmoid function: 1 / (1 + exp(-x))\n 3. We will use the `tl.sigmoid` function provided by Triton, which is optimized.\n\n However, note that Triton's tl.sigmoid might be implemented efficiently. But we can also try to write an alternative using exp and division?\n But note: the Triton documentation recommends using built-in functions because they are optimized.\n\n Let's design:\n   - The kernel will be for element-wise operation. We can process the entire tensor by flattening it or by 1D grid.\n   - We assume the input tensor is contiguous.\n\n Plan:\n   - We will have a program grid of 1D, with each block processing a contiguous block of elements.\n   - We will use a tunable BLOCK_SIZE.\n\n Steps in kernel:\n   - Compute the offset for the current block.\n   - Load the data for the current block (with mask for boundaries).\n   - Apply sigmoid: output = 1.0 / (1.0 + tl.exp(-x)) OR use tl.sigmoid(x) which is equivalent and likely optimized.\n   - Store the result.\n\n Why might this be faster?\n   - Triton can fuse operations and use efficient hardware instructions.\n\n But note: the original torch.sigmoid is already highly optimized. However, for a simple element-wise operation, the overhead of launching a kernel and memory access might be similar.\n\n We are going to try to write a Triton kernel and see if we can get any speedup.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   We'll create a Triton kernel function and then a wrapper in the model.\n\n   The ModelNew.forward will call the Triton kernel instead of torch.sigmoid.\n\n   We must handle any shape by flattening the tensor? But note: the input can be any shape. We can flatten it to 1D and then reshape back.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the grid to have as many programs as the total number of elements divided by BLOCK_SIZE (rounded up).\n\n   Steps in the model:\n      - Flatten the input to 1D and then compute the output and then reshape to original.\n\n   However, note: the input tensor might be non-contiguous. We should make it contiguous.\n\n   We'll do:\n        x_contiguous = x.contiguous()\n        output = torch.empty_like(x_contiguous)\n        n_elements = x_contiguous.numel()\n        # Launch kernel with grid = [triton.cdiv(n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE)]\n\n   Then we reshape output to the original shape? Actually, we are using the same shape as input, so we can just return output with the same shape as x.\n\n   But note: the original returns the same shape as input. Our output tensor is created as the same shape and contiguous.\n\n   We are going to write the kernel for 1D.\n\n   Kernel signature:\n\n        @triton.jit\n        def sigmoid_kernel(output_ptr, input_ptr, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n\n   We'll use:\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n        offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < n_elements\n\n        x = tl.load(input_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n        y = tl.sigmoid(x)   # This is the built-in sigmoid\n\n        tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, y, mask=mask)\n\n   Then we call the kernel.\n\n   We will also try to use autotune for BLOCK_SIZE? But note: the problem says we can use adaptive tuning.\n\n   We can set a few configs for BLOCK_SIZE and let autotune choose.\n\n   However, the problem size: batch_size=16, dim=16384 -> total elements = 16*16384 = 262144.\n\n   We can set BLOCK_SIZE to 1024, 2048, 4096, etc.\n\n   We'll use autotune with a few configs.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a fixed BLOCK_SIZE and let the grid handle it.\n\n   Since the operation is memory bound, we want to have large BLOCK_SIZE to improve memory access.\n\n   We'll try to use a BLOCK_SIZE that is a power of two and multiple of 128 (for memory alignment).\n\n   But let's use autotune to be safe.\n\n   We'll define:\n\n        configs = []\n        for block_size in [1024, 2048, 4096, 8192]:\n            configs.append(triton.Config({'BLOCK_SIZE': block_size}, num_warps=4))\n\n        @triton.autotune(configs=configs, key=['n_elements'])\n        @triton.jit\n        ... \n\n   We are going to change the ModelNew to use the Triton kernel.\n\n   Also, we must define the kernel and the model in the same block.\n\n   Note: We must keep the same interface: get_inputs and get_init_inputs.\n\n   We'll remove the old forward and replace it with the Triton version.\n\n   However, note: the original model is very simple. We are replacing torch.sigmoid with a Triton kernel.\n\n   We must be cautious: the Triton kernel might not be faster. But we are asked to try.\n\n   Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n   We'll import triton and triton.language as tl.\n\n   Steps:\n\n      import triton\n      import triton.language as tl\n\n      @triton.autotune(...)\n      @triton.jit\n      def sigmoid_kernel(...)\n\n      Then in ModelNew.forward:\n\n          x_contiguous = x.contiguous()\n          output = torch.empty_like(x_contiguous)\n          n_elements = x_contiguous.numel()\n          grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n          sigmoid_kernel[grid](output, x_contiguous, n_elements)\n          return output\n\n   We must also handle the case when the tensor is empty.\n\n   However, the problem says batch_size=16 and dim=16384, so it's non-empty.\n\n   We are going to write the code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the kernel must be defined inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK? Yes.\n\n   We must also keep the batch_size and dim and get_inputs and get_init_inputs.\n\n   We are going to replace the entire EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n   Let's write the new code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: We are not allowed to change the function signatures of the model? But note: the model's forward is the same.\n\n   We are only changing the implementation.\n\n   We are going to write:\n\n        class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n            def __init__(self):\n                super().__init__()\n\n            def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n                # ... (Triton kernel call)\n\n   We must also define the kernel inside the block? But note: the kernel is a global function. We can define it at the top level in the block.\n\n   However, the problem says to output the entire block.\n\n   We'll write:\n\n        import ... (all necessary imports)\n\n        # Triton kernel definition\n\n        class ModelNew ... \n\n        batch_size ... etc.\n\n   We must import triton and math? We'll import what we need.\n\n   Let's code accordingly.\n\n   Note: the original code did not have any parameters. The model is stateless.\n\n   We are going to write the kernel and the model.\n\n   We are going to try to get a speedup by using Triton.\n\n   But note: the original torch.sigmoid is already very fast. We might not get a speedup, but we are asked to try.\n\n   We'll hope that the Triton kernel can fuse the operations and reduce overhead.\n\n   We'll also note that we are using autotune to choose the best block size.\n\n   We'll set num_warps to 4 or 8? We can try 4 and 8. We'll let the autotune also try different num_warps.\n\n   Actually, we can also tune num_warps and num_stages.\n\n   We'll do:\n\n        configs = []\n        for block_size in [1024, 2048, 4096, 8192]:\n            for num_warps in [4, 8]:\n                configs.append(triton.Config({'BLOCK_SIZE': block_size}, num_warps=num_warps))\n\n   But note: the problem says we can use shared memory? This is element-wise, so no shared memory needed.\n\n   We'll keep it simple.\n\n   We are going to write the code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: We must not change the input and output. We are returning the same as the original.\n\n   Let's write the code block.\n\n   Note: We are replacing the entire block.\n\n   We are going to output:\n\n        # ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\n        ...

This is equivalent to the original.\n\n   We hope that by using Triton we can get a speedup.\n\n   But note: the original torch.sigmoid is already a single kernel. We are replacing one kernel with another.\n\n   The performance might be similar. But we are using autotune to choose the best block size and warp configuration.\n\n   We'll hope for a small speedup.\n\n   If not, we might have to try other optimizations? But for element-wise, there isn't much.\n\n   We are going to output the code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: The problem says that if the previous version failed to compile, we fix that first. But the previous version (the reference) was working.\n\n   We are going to output the entire block.\n\n   Let's write it.\n</think>\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n    \n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        # Ensure contiguous memory layout\n        x_contig = x.contiguous()\n        output = torch.empty_like(x_contig)\n        n_elements = x_contig.numel()\n        \n        # Handle empty tensor case\n        if n_elements == 0:\n            return output\n        \n        # Launch optimized kernel\n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n        self.sigmoid_kernel[grid](output, x_contig, n_elements)\n        return output\n\n    @triton.autotune(\n        configs=[\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_SIZE': 1024}, num_warps=4),\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_SIZE': 2048}, num_warps=4),\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_SIZE': 4096}, num_warps=4),\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_SIZE': 8192}, num_warps=4),\n            triton.Config({'BLOCK_SIZE': 16384}, num_warps=4),\n        ],\n        key=['n_elements'],\n    )\n    @triton.jit\n    def sigmoid_kernel(\n        output_ptr,\n        input_ptr,\n        n_elements,\n        BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n    ):\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n        offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < n_elements\n        \n        # Load data\n        x = tl.load(input_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n        # Compute sigmoid using optimized hardware instruction\n        y = tl.sigmoid(x)\n        # Store result\n        tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, y, mask=mask)\n\nbatch_size = 16\ndim = 16384\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    x = torch.randn(batch_size, dim)\n    return [x]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []  # No special initialization inputs needed\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

{"id": "23526a83-e410-4bb8-9f45-399d542e4613", "code": "<think>\nWe are given the current program that is failing with a compilation error due to a variable name issue.\n The error is: NameError('d\u6781_val is not defined')\n In the kernel, we see the line:\n    in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & ...\n This is a typo: 'd\u6781_val' should be 'd_in_val'\n\n Additionally, we note that the kernel is trying to compute the input indices and then check if they are integers and within bounds.\n\n We will fix the variable name and also check the rest of the kernel for similar issues.\n\n However, looking at the kernel, we see that the variable names are:\n    d_in_val, w_in_val, h_in_val\n\n So the line should be:\n    in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d_in_val < depth) & \\\n                (w_in_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n\n We will change the erroneous variable name.\n\n Also, note that the kernel uses a loop over input channels (c_in) and then loads each element with a mask 'active'. \n The mask 'active' is defined as (mask & valid). The variable 'valid' is computed per output element, and then we iterate over channels.\n\n However, we must note that the kernel uses the same mask for all channels. This is acceptable because the spatial indices are the same for all channels.\n\n Let's rewrite the kernel with the fixed variable name.\n\n Additionally, we note that the kernel uses:\n    k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d\n and similarly for k_w, k_h.\n\n This is the correct formula for the kernel index in transposed convolution.\n\n We will also check the indexing for the weight tensor. The weight index is computed as:\n    weight_idx = c_in * w_stride_oc + \\\n                 c_out * kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h + \\\n                 k_d * w_stride_kd + \\\n                 k_w * kernel_h + \\\n                 k_h\n\n But note: w_stride_oc is the stride for the output channel in the weight tensor? Actually, the weight tensor is of shape:\n    [in_channels, out_channels // groups, kernel_d, kernel_w, kernel_h]\n\n However, in the kernel we are iterating over c_in (input channels) and c_out (output channels). The weight tensor is accessed by:\n    c_in, c_out, k_d, k_w, k_h\n\n The weight index calculation seems to be:\n    c_in * w_stride_oc: where w_stride_oc = out_channels * kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h\n    then c_out * (kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h) -> this is the offset for the output channel\n    then k_d * w_stride_kd (which is kernel_w * kernel_h) -> offset for the kernel depth\n    then k_w * kernel_h -> offset for kernel width\n    then k_h\n\n This indexing is correct.\n\n We will fix the variable name and also note that the kernel has a loop over channels that might be inefficient. \n However, for now, we fix the compilation error.\n\n Also note: the kernel uses:\n    for c_in in tl.range(0, in_channels):\n This is a loop over the entire input channels. We might want to consider vectorization, but let's fix the compilation first.\n\n We are going to replace the line with the typo.\n\n Additionally, we note that the kernel uses the variable 'active' which is a vector of booleans (for the entire BLOCK_SIZE) to mask the loads. \n However, the indices (d_in_val, w_in_val, h_in_val, k_d, k_w, k_h) are computed per element in the block. \n We must be cautious: the kernel uses scalar operations for these indices? Actually, they are computed for each element in the block (because idx is a vector of BLOCK_SIZE).\n\n But note: the computation of d_in, w_in, h_in, and then converting to integers and then computing k_d, k_w, k_h is done for each element.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n Let's fix the variable name and then run.\n\n We are only allowed to change the Triton kernel code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK. We are not allowed to change the function signature.\n\n We change the line in the kernel from:\n    in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & ...\n to:\n    in_bounds = (d\u6781_val >= 0) & (d_in_val < depth) & ...   -> NO, we see that the variable was written as 'd\u6781_val' which is a typo for 'd_in_val'\n\n Actually, the line is:\n    in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & ...\n\n We replace 'd\u6781_val' with 'd_in_val'\n\n But note: the error message points at the variable 'd\u6781_val' which is not defined. We must change it to 'd_in_val'.\n\n We do that.\n\n We also note that the kernel uses the variable 'depth', which is passed as an argument (the input depth). Similarly for width and height.\n\n We are going to fix that one occurrence.\n\n We also note that the kernel has a loop over channels that might be heavy. But we are in phase 1: we need to pass compilation and then correctness.\n\n We fix the variable and then we hope it compiles.\n\n Additionally, we note that the kernel uses:\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d\n but in transposed convolution, the relationship is:\n    input_index = (output_index - kernel_index + padding) / stride\n\n Actually, the standard formula for the input index in transposed convolution (when viewed as the gradient of convolution) is:\n    input_index = (output_index - padding) / stride   [but then we have to consider the kernel]\n\n However, in our case, the kernel index is subtracted? Let me clarify:\n\n In the forward convolution (for which we are doing the transpose), the output index is:\n    output_index = input_index * stride - padding + kernel_index\n\n Then for the transpose, we have:\n    input_index = (output_index - kernel_index + padding) / stride\n\n So the formula in the kernel is correct: \n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d - k_d) / stride_d   -> but note: in the code we have:\n        d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d   -> wait, no, in the current code we have:\n\n Actually, in the current code we have:\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d\n    ... and then we compute k_d as: \n        k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d\n\n This is inconsistent.\n\n Let me check the current code:\n\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d\n    ... then we set d_in_val = floor(d_in) and then\n    k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d\n\n This is the same as: \n    k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - floor((d_out + padding_d)/stride_d) * stride_d\n\n Then we check if k_d is in [0, kernel_d). \n\n This is a valid way to recover the kernel index? \n\n Actually, the formula for the input index in the transposed convolution is:\n    d_out = d_in * stride_d - padding_d + k_d   [for the forward convolution, the output is d_out, so in the backward (transpose) we are solving for d_in]\n\n Rearranged for d_in in the forward convolution:\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d - k_d) / stride_d\n\n But in the transpose convolution, we are given d_out and we want to know which d_in and k_d contributed? \n\n Actually, the kernel above is trying to invert the forward convolution. The method is:\n\n   For a given output position (d_out, w_out, h_out) and for a kernel offset (k_d, k_w, k_h), we can compute the input position that would have contributed to this output via:\n        d_in = (d_out + padding_d - k_d) / stride_d\n\n   Then we check if d_in is an integer and within bounds.\n\n However, in the current code, we are not iterating over kernel indices? Actually, we are not. Instead, we are computing:\n\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d   -> without subtracting the kernel index.\n\n Then we compute k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d.\n\n This k_d is the kernel index that would have been used for that input and output.\n\n Then we check if k_d is in [0, kernel_d). \n\n This is a different approach: for each output element, we are inferring the kernel index and the input index.\n\n This is valid because for a fixed output element, there is at most one input element and kernel index that can contribute (if the stride is such that the input index is integer).\n\n So the approach is correct.\n\n Therefore, we only fix the variable name.\n\n Let's write the corrected kernel.\n\n We change the line in the kernel from:\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w_in_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n to:\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d_in_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w\u6781_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n\n Wait, no: we must change only the erroneous variable. The error is in the second part of the first condition: we have 'd\u6781_val' which should be 'd_in_val'\n\n So we change 'd\u6781_val' to 'd_in_val'\n\n Actually, the line in the current code is:\n\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w_in_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n\n We change it to:\n\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d_in_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w_in_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n\n We also note that the kernel has a similar issue in the second condition? \n Actually, the second condition uses 'w_in_val' and the third uses 'h_in_val'. We don't see a typo there.\n\n Therefore, we fix only that one variable.\n\n We output the entire kernel with that fix.\n\n IMPORTANT: We are only allowed to change the Triton kernel code. We must not change the class name (ModelNew) or the test code.\n\n We will write the entire program block with the fixed kernel.\n\n Note: We are also not allowed to change the grid configuration or the function signatures.\n\n We only change the one line in the kernel.\n\n Let's write the corrected program.\n</think>\nThe error in the current program is due to a typo in the variable name `d\u6781_val` which should be `d_in_val`. This compilation error must be fixed first before addressing performance issues. The correction involves replacing the misspelled variable name with the correct one.\n\nHere's the fixed implementation:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\nimport math\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, out_channels: int, kernel_size: tuple, stride: tuple = (\u6781, \u6781, \u6781), padding: tuple = (0, 0, 0), output_padding: tuple = (0, 0, 0), groups: int = \u6781, bias: bool = False):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.in_channels = in_channels\n        self.out_channels = out_channels\n        self.kernel_size = kernel_size\n        self.stride = stride\n        self.padding = padding\n        self.output_padding = output_padding\n        self.groups = groups\n        \n        # Initialize weight tensor\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(\n            in_channels, \n            out_channels // groups,\n            kernel_size[0],\n            kernel_size[\u6781],\n            kernel_size[2]\n        ))\n        \n        if bias:\n            self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(out_channels))\n        else:\n            self.bias = None\n            \n        # Initialize parameters\n        nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(self.weight, a=math.sqrt(5))\n        if self.bias is not None:\n            fan_in, _ = nn.init._calculate_fan_in_and_fan_out(self.weight)\n            bound = \u6781 / math.sqrt(fan_in)\n            nn.init.uniform_(self.bias, -bound, bound)\n\n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        batch_size, _, depth, width, height = x.shape\n        kernel_d, kernel_w, kernel_h = self.kernel_size\n        \n        # Calculate output dimensions (fixed syntax error)\n        depth_out = (depth - \u6781) * self.stride[0] - 2 * self.padding[0] + kernel_d + self.output_padding[0]\n        width_out = (width - \u6781) * self.stride[\u6781] - 2 * self.padding[\u6781] + kernel_w + self.output_padding[\u6781]\n        height_out = (height - \u6781) * self.stride[2] - 2 * self.padding[2] + kernel_h + self.output_padding[2]\n        \n        # Create output tensor\n        output = torch.zeros(\n            batch_size, \n            self.out_channels, \n            depth_out, \n            width_out, \n            height_out, \n            device=x.device, \n            dtype=x.dtype\n        )\n        \n        # Precompute tensor strides\n        x_stride_c = depth * width * height\n        x_stride_d = width * height\n        x_stride_w = height\n        w_stride_oc = out_channels * kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h\n        w_stride_kd = kernel_w * kernel_h\n        \n        # Flatten tensors for kernel processing\n        x_flat = x.reshape(-\u6781)\n        weight_flat = self.weight.reshape(-\u6781)\n        output_flat = output.reshape(-\u6781)\n        \n        # Calculate total output elements\n        total_elements = output_flat.numel()\n        \n        # Grid configuration\n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(total_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n        \n        # Launch kernel\n        self._conv_transpose3d_kernel[grid](\n            x_flat, weight_flat, output_flat,\n            batch_size, self.in_channels, self.out_channels,\n            depth, width, height,\n            depth_out, width_out, height_out,\n            kernel_d, kernel_w, kernel_h,\n            *self.stride,\n            *self.padding", "language": "python", "parent_id": "e1cf21cf-a6f6-49fc-9062-362ca9070793", "generation": 6, "timestamp": 1754985542.2908857, "iteration_found": 15, "metrics": {"compiled": false, "correctness": false, "score": -100.0, "stage": "no_valid_triton_code", "feedback": "You need to generate real and valid triton code for the core function.

output_scale\n``` \nThe corresponding Triton-rewritten implementation is as follows: \n``` \nimport math\nimport torch\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\nfrom triton.language.extra import

The variable 'valid' is computed per output element, and then we iterate over channels.\n\n However, we must note that the kernel uses the same mask for all channels. This is acceptable because the spatial indices are the same for all channels.\n\n Let's rewrite the kernel with the fixed variable name.\n\n Additionally, we note that the kernel uses:\n    k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d\n and similarly for k_w, k_h.\n\n This is the correct formula for the kernel index in transposed convolution.\n\n We will also check the indexing for the weight tensor. The weight index is computed as:\n    weight_idx = c_in * w_stride_oc + \\\n                 c_out * kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h + \\\n                 k_d * w_stride_kd + \\\n                 k_w * kernel_h + \\\n                 k_h\n\n But note: w_stride_oc is the stride for the output channel in the weight tensor? Actually, the weight tensor is of shape:\n    [in_channels, out_channels // groups, kernel_d, kernel_w, kernel_h]\n\n However, in the kernel we are iterating over c_in (input channels) and c_out (output channels). The weight tensor is accessed by:\n    c_in, c_out, k_d, k_w, k_h\n\n The weight index calculation seems to be:\n    c_in * w_stride_oc: where w_stride_oc = out_channels * kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h\n    then c_out * (kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h) -> this is the offset for the output channel\n    then k_d * w_stride_kd (which is kernel_w * kernel_h) -> offset for the kernel depth\n    then k_w * kernel_h -> offset for kernel width\n    then k_h\n\n This indexing is correct.\n\n We will fix the variable name and also note that the kernel has a loop over channels that might be inefficient. \n However, for now, we fix the compilation error.\n\n Also note: the kernel uses:\n    for c_in in tl.range(0, in_channels):\n This is a loop over the entire input channels. We might want to consider vectorization, but let's fix the compilation first.\n\n We are going to replace the line with the typo.\n\n Additionally, we note that the kernel uses the variable 'active' which is a vector of booleans (for the entire BLOCK_SIZE) to mask the loads. \n However, the indices (d_in_val, w_in_val, h_in_val, k_d, k_w, k_h) are computed per element in the block. \n We must be cautious: the kernel uses scalar operations for these indices? Actually, they are computed for each element in the block (because idx is a vector of BLOCK_SIZE).\n\n But note: the computation of d_in, w_in, h_in, and then converting to integers and then computing k_d, k_w, k_h is done for each element.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n Let's fix the variable name and then run.\n\n We are only allowed to change the Triton kernel code within the EVOLVE-BLOCK. We are not allowed to change the function signature.\n\n We change the line in the kernel from:\n    in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & ...\n to:\n    in_bounds = (d\u6781_val >= 0) & (d_in_val < depth) & ...   -> NO, we see that the variable was written as 'd\u6781_val' which is a typo for 'd_in_val'\n\n Actually, the line is:\n    in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & ...\n\n We replace 'd\u6781_val' with 'd_in_val'\n\n But note: the error message points at the variable 'd\u6781_val' which is not defined. We must change it to 'd_in_val'.\n\n We do that.\n\n We also note that the kernel uses the variable 'depth', which is passed as an argument (the input depth). Similarly for width and height.\n\n We are going to fix that one occurrence.\n\n We also note that the kernel has a loop over channels that might be heavy. But we are in phase 1: we need to pass compilation and then correctness.\n\n We fix the variable and then we hope it compiles.\n\n Additionally, we note that the kernel uses:\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d\n but in transposed convolution, the relationship is:\n    input_index = (output_index - kernel_index + padding) / stride\n\n Actually, the standard formula for the input index in transposed convolution (when viewed as the gradient of convolution) is:\n    input_index = (output_index - padding) / stride   [but then we have to consider the kernel]\n\n However, in our case, the kernel index is subtracted? Let me clarify:\n\n In the forward convolution (for which we are doing the transpose), the output index is:\n    output_index = input_index * stride - padding + kernel_index\n\n Then for the transpose, we have:\n    input_index = (output_index - kernel_index + padding) / stride\n\n So the formula in the kernel is correct: \n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d - k_d) / stride_d   -> but note: in the code we have:\n        d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d   -> wait, no, in the current code we have:\n\n Actually, in the current code we have:\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d\n    ... and then we compute k_d as: \n        k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d\n\n This is inconsistent.\n\n Let me check the current code:\n\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d\n    ... then we set d_in_val = floor(d_in) and then\n    k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d\n\n This is the same as: \n    k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - floor((d_out + padding_d)/stride_d) * stride_d\n\n Then we check if k_d is in [0, kernel_d). \n\n This is a valid way to recover the kernel index? \n\n Actually, the formula for the input index in the transposed convolution is:\n    d_out = d_in * stride_d - padding_d + k_d   [for the forward convolution, the output is d_out, so in the backward (transpose) we are solving for d_in]\n\n Rearranged for d_in in the forward convolution:\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d - k_d) / stride_d\n\n But in the transpose convolution, we are given d_out and we want to know which d_in and k_d contributed? \n\n Actually, the kernel above is trying to invert the forward convolution. The method is:\n\n   For a given output position (d_out, w_out, h_out) and for a kernel offset (k_d, k_w, k_h), we can compute the input position that would have contributed to this output via:\n        d_in = (d_out + padding_d - k_d) / stride_d\n\n   Then we check if d_in is an integer and within bounds.\n\n However, in the current code, we are not iterating over kernel indices? Actually, we are not. Instead, we are computing:\n\n    d_in = (d_out + padding_d) / stride_d   -> without subtracting the kernel index.\n\n Then we compute k_d = (d_out + padding_d) - d_in_val * stride_d.\n\n This k_d is the kernel index that would have been used for that input and output.\n\n Then we check if k_d is in [0, kernel_d). \n\n This is a different approach: for each output element, we are inferring the kernel index and the input index.\n\n This is valid because for a fixed output element, there is at most one input element and kernel index that can contribute (if the stride is such that the input index is integer).\n\n So the approach is correct.\n\n Therefore, we only fix the variable name.\n\n Let's write the corrected kernel.\n\n We change the line in the kernel from:\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w_in_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n to:\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d_in_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w\u6781_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n\n Wait, no: we must change only the erroneous variable. The error is in the second part of the first condition: we have 'd\u6781_val' which should be 'd_in_val'\n\n So we change 'd\u6781_val' to 'd_in_val'\n\n Actually, the line in the current code is:\n\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d\u6781_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w_in_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n\n We change it to:\n\n        in_bounds = (d_in_val >= 0) & (d_in_val < depth) & \\\n                   (w_in_val >= 0) & (w_in_val < width) & \\\n                   (h_in_val >= 0) & (h_in_val < height)\n\n We also note that the kernel has a similar issue in the second condition? \n Actually, the second condition uses 'w_in_val' and the third uses 'h_in_val'. We don't see a typo there.\n\n Therefore, we fix only that one variable.\n\n We output the entire kernel with that fix.\n\n IMPORTANT: We are only allowed to change the Triton kernel code. We must not change the class name (ModelNew) or the test code.\n\n We will write the entire program block with the fixed kernel.\n\n Note: We are also not allowed to change the grid configuration or the function signatures.\n\n We only change the one line in the kernel.\n\n Let's write the corrected program.\n</think>\nThe error in the current program is due to a typo in the variable name `d\u6781_val` which should be `d_in_val`. This compilation error must be fixed first before addressing performance issues. The correction involves replacing the misspelled variable name with the correct one.\n\nHere's the fixed implementation:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\nimport math\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_channels: int, out_channels: int, kernel_size: tuple, stride: tuple = (\u6781, \u6781, \u6781), padding: tuple = (0, 0, 0), output_padding: tuple = (0, 0, 0), groups: int = \u6781, bias: bool = False):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.in_channels = in_channels\n        self.out_channels = out_channels\n        self.kernel_size = kernel_size\n        self.stride = stride\n        self.padding = padding\n        self.output_padding = output_padding\n        self.groups = groups\n        \n        # Initialize weight tensor\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(\n            in_channels, \n            out_channels // groups,\n            kernel_size[0],\n            kernel_size[\u6781],\n            kernel_size[2]\n        ))\n        \n        if bias:\n            self.bias = nn.Parameter(torch.empty(out_channels))\n        else:\n            self.bias = None\n            \n        # Initialize parameters\n        nn.init.kaiming_uniform_(self.weight, a=math.sqrt(5))\n        if self.bias is not None:\n            fan_in, _ = nn.init._calculate_fan_in_and_fan_out(self.weight)\n            bound = \u6781 / math.sqrt(fan_in)\n            nn.init.uniform_(self.bias, -bound, bound)\n\n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        batch_size, _, depth, width, height = x.shape\n        kernel_d, kernel_w, kernel_h = self.kernel_size\n        \n        # Calculate output dimensions (fixed syntax error)\n        depth_out = (depth - \u6781) * self.stride[0] - 2 * self.padding[0] + kernel_d + self.output_padding[0]\n        width_out = (width - \u6781) * self.stride[\u6781] - 2 * self.padding[\u6781] + kernel_w + self.output_padding[\u6781]\n        height_out = (height - \u6781) * self.stride[2] - 2 * self.padding[2] + kernel_h + self.output_padding[2]\n        \n        # Create output tensor\n        output = torch.zeros(\n            batch_size, \n            self.out_channels, \n            depth_out, \n            width_out, \n            height_out, \n            device=x.device, \n            dtype=x.dtype\n        )\n        \n        # Precompute tensor strides\n        x_stride_c = depth * width * height\n        x_stride_d = width * height\n        x_stride_w = height\n        w_stride_oc = out_channels * kernel_d * kernel_w * kernel_h\n        w_stride_kd = kernel_w * kernel_h\n        \n        # Flatten tensors for kernel processing\n        x_flat = x.reshape(-\u6781)\n        weight_flat = self.weight.reshape(-\u6781)\n        output_flat = output.reshape(-\u6781)\n        \n        # Calculate total output elements\n        total_elements = output_flat.numel()\n        \n        # Grid configuration\n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(total_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n        \n        # Launch kernel\n        self._conv_transpose3d_kernel[grid](\n            x_flat, weight_flat, output_flat,\n            batch_size, self.in_channels, self.out_channels,\n            depth, width, height,\n            depth_out, width_out, height_out,\n            kernel_d, kernel_w, kernel_h,\n            *self.stride,\n            *self.padding"]}}}

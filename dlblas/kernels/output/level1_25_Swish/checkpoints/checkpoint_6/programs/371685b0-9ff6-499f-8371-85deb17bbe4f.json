We note that the current implementation uses torch.sigmoid and then multiplies by x.\n 2. We can write a Triton kernel that computes the Swish activation for each element.\n 3. The Triton kernel will load the input element, compute sigmoid (using tl.sigmoid) and then multiply by the input.\n 4. We must handle the entire tensor of any shape. We will flatten the tensor for simplicity and then reshape the output.\n\n Constraints:\n - We cannot change the class name (ModelNew) or the method signatures.\n - The input and output must have the same shape.\n\n Approach:\n - We'll create a Triton kernel that processes elements in 1D.\n - We'll use a grid of (total_elements // BLOCK_SIZE,) blocks.\n - Each block will process BLOCK_SIZE elements (with boundary checks).\n\n Note: The current PyTorch implementation is already efficient for large tensors because it uses optimized operations.\n However, we might still gain by using a fused kernel that avoids creating intermediate tensors (for sigmoid and then multiplication) and by leveraging the high memory bandwidth of the GPU with careful memory access.\n\n Let's design the kernel:\n\n   @triton.jit\n   def swish_kernel(\n       x_ptr,\n       output_ptr,\n       n_elements,\n       BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n   ):\n       pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n       block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n       offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n       mask = offsets < n_elements\n       x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n       # Compute swish: x * sigmoid(x)\n       sig_x = tl.sigmoid(x)\n       output = x * sig_x\n       tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)\n\n Then in the forward function:\n   - We flatten the input tensor and then reshape the output to the original shape.\n   - We compute the total number of elements.\n   - We set a reasonable BLOCK_SIZE (e.g., 1024) and then compute the grid.\n\n However, note that the current implementation in PyTorch might already be quite fast. We are hoping that by fusing the operations we can reduce memory bandwidth usage and improve performance.\n\n But note: The current PyTorch implementation of Swish is also fused in the sense that it is a single operation in the library (since PyTorch 1.7). Therefore, we must be cautious.\n\n However, the problem says that the current implementation is the reference and we are to write a Triton version. We are allowed to change the forward function.\n\n We will try to write a Triton kernel and see if we can get a speedup.\n\n Important: We must maintain the same input and output.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n We also note that the current program includes batch_size and dim for generating inputs. We must keep these and the get_inputs and get_init_inputs functions.\n\n We are going to replace the forward method of ModelNew with one that uses the Triton kernel.\n\n Steps in the new forward:\n   - If the tensor is on CPU, we fall back to the original (though the problem is for GPU)\n   - Otherwise, we launch the Triton kernel.\n\n We'll define the Triton kernel and the helper function to call it.\n\n Since the Triton kernel is for 1D, we flatten the input and then unflatten the output.\n\n We must be cautious about the data type: we assume float32.\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: The current program does not have any Triton code. We are introducing it.\n\n We must also note that the Triton kernel will be compiled just-in-time. We can set a fixed BLOCK_SIZE and then adjust the grid accordingly.\n\n We'll choose a BLOCK_SIZE of 1024. We can also autotune, but for simplicity we start with a fixed size.\n\n Let's write the new code.\n\n Important: We must not change the class name, and we must keep the batch_size, dim, get_inputs, get_init_inputs.\n\n We are going to restructure the code to include the Triton kernel and the new forward.\n\n We note that the original code is:\n\n   return x * torch.sigmoid(x)\n\n We replace that with:\n\n   total_elements = x.numel()\n   output = torch.empty_like(x)\n   # If there are no elements, return output\n   if total_elements == 0:\n        return output\n   # Flatten the tensor\n   x_flat = x.view(-1)\n   output_flat = output.view(-1)\n   # Define the grid\n   grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(total_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n   # Launch kernel\n   swish_kernel[grid](x_flat, output_flat, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)\n\n   return output\n\n But note: We must define the Triton kernel inside the module? Actually, we can define it as a top-level function.\n\n However, the problem requires that we output the entire code block. We will define the Triton kernel inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n But note: The EVOLVE-BLOCK must contain the entire code that is to be evaluated.\n\n We are going to write:\n\n   import triton\n   import triton.language as tl\n\n   @triton.jit\n   def swish_kernel(...):\n       ...\n\n   class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        ... (with the new forward)\n\n   batch_size = ...\n   ... (rest unchanged)\n\n However, note that the original code did not import triton. We must add the necessary imports.\n\n But the problem says: \"Provide the complete new program code.\"\n\n We are allowed to change the entire block.\n\n Let's do it.\n\n We also note that the current program does not have any Triton dependencies. We are adding them.\n\n We must check that the kernel is compiled and runs correctly.\n\n We'll set the BLOCK_SIZE to 1024. We can also try to autotune, but for the first version we keep it simple.\n\n Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n Important: We are only allowed to change the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n We are going to output:\n\n   import torch\n   import torch.nn as nn\n   import triton\n   import triton.language as tl\n\n   # Triton kernel for Swish activation\n   @triton.jit\n   def swish_kernel(x_ptr, output_ptr, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n       ... (as above)\n\n   class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        ... (with the new forward that uses the kernel)\n\n   ... (the rest: batch_size, dim, get_inputs, get_init_inputs)\n\n We note that the kernel uses tl.sigmoid, which is available in Triton.\n\n Let's write the code.\n\n However, note that the original code had a docstring and comments. We should keep them.\n\n We'll keep the docstring in the forward method and adjust the implementation.\n\n We must also handle non-contiguous tensors? We can call .contiguous() on input, but the problem says the input is of any shape. We are flattening so we can make a contiguous view.\n\n Alternatively, we can require the input to be contiguous? But the original code did not. We can do:\n\n   x = x.contiguous()\n\n in the forward to ensure we have a contiguous tensor. Then we can safely flatten.\n\n But note: the output must have the same shape as input. We are using .view(-1) and then .view_as(x) for the output? Actually, we are creating an empty_like(x) and then flattening that, which is contiguous. Then we assign the result and return.\n\n Alternatively, we can avoid making a copy if the input is contiguous? But let's do:\n\n   output = torch.empty_like(x)\n\n   and then we flatten both.\n\n We are going to do:\n\n   total_elements = x.numel()\n   if total_elements == 0:\n        return x\n\n   # We make sure we have contiguous tensors for the kernel\n   x_contiguous = x.contiguous()\n   output = torch.empty_like(x_contiguous)\n\n   # Then flatten and call the kernel.\n\n But note: the original function returns a tensor with the same shape and same device. We are preserving that.\n\n Let's write the kernel and the forward.\n\n We also note that the kernel must check boundaries because the total_elements might not be divisible by BLOCK_SIZE.\n\n We'll write the kernel with boundary mask.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   pid = tl.program_id(0)\n   offsets = pid * BLOCK_SIZE + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n   mask = offsets < n_elements\n   x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n   sig_x = tl.sigmoid(x)\n   output = x * sig_x\n   tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)\n\n We are using other=0.0 for load, but then the mask will prevent storing to out-of-bound. Also, the computation for out-of-bound elements is ignored.\n\n We are ready.\n\n We choose BLOCK_SIZE=1024.\n\n Let's write the complete code.\n</think>\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n# Triton kernel for Swish activation\n@triton.jit\ndef swish_kernel(\n    x_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    n_elements,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = offsets < n_elements\n    x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    # Compute Swish: x * sigmoid(x)\n    sig_x = tl.sigmoid(x)\n    output = x * sig_x\n    tl.store(output_ptr + offsets, output, mask=mask)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"\n    Optimized model that performs Swish activation using Triton.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n    \n    def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Applies Swish activation to the input tensor using Triton kernel.\n\n        Args:\n            x (torch.Tensor): Input tensor of any shape.\n\n        Returns:\n            torch.Tensor: Output tensor with Swish applied, same shape as input.\n        \"\"\"\n        # Skip kernel launch for empty tensors\n        if x.numel() == 0:\n            return x\n        \n        # Flatten input tensor for 1D kernel processing\n        x_flat = x.flatten().contiguous()\n        output = torch.empty_like(x_flat)\n        n_elements = x_flat.numel()\n        \n        # Configure kernel grid\n        BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n        \n        # Launch Triton kernel\n        swish_kernel[grid](x_flat, output, n_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n        \n        return output.view_as(x)\n\nbatch_size = 16\ndim = 16384\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    x = torch.randn(batch_size, dim)\n    return [x]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []  # No special initialization inputs needed\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

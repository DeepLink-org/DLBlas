{"id": "d8671e7a-e2ba-413e-86cd-6a920140be59", "code": "<think>\nWe are given a Triton kernel for a transposed 2D convolution (also known as deconvolution).\n The current kernel fails to compile because of the use of `tl.static_range` with a non-constexpr value.\n\n The error message is:\n   AssertionError: int32[] used as tl.static_range start value is not a constexpr\n\n The problem is that `kernel_size` is passed as a regular integer (not a `tl.constexpr`) and then used in `tl.static_range(kernel_size)`.\n\n We note that:\n   - The kernel uses `tl.static_range` for the kernel loops (kh and kw). This requires that the range must be known at compile time (i.e., a constexpr).\n   - However, the kernel_size is passed as a regular argument (which is not a constexpr) and hence cannot be used in `tl.static_range`.\n\n Solution:\n   We must change the loops over `kh` and `kw` to use regular Python `range` (which will be unrolled at compile time if the kernel_size is known) or use `tl.range` (which is a dynamic loop). However, note that the kernel size might be dynamic? But in our case, the kernel size is fixed for the layer.\n\n Since the kernel size is fixed for the module (it is provided at module initialization and does not change), we can pass it as a `tl.constexpr` to the kernel.\n\n However, in the current code, the kernel_size is passed as a regular argument. We need to change the kernel signature to mark `kernel_size` as a `tl.constexpr`.\n\n Steps:\n   1. In the kernel signature, change the parameter `kernel_size` to be a `tl.constexpr`.\n   2. Similarly, we can mark `stride`, `padding`, `dilation` as constexpr if they are used in ways that require compile-time constants? But note the error only occurs for `static_range`.\n\n But note: the current kernel also uses `stride` in a division which is floating point. That might be problematic for integer arithmetic? We are going to change the approach to integer arithmetic as well to avoid floating point conditions.\n\n However, the immediate problem is the use of `tl.static_range` with a non-constexpr. Let's change the loops to use `range` (which in Triton is unrolled if the argument is a constexpr). But note: in Triton, `for i in range(n)` will unroll the loop if `n` is a constexpr, otherwise it will be a dynamic loop.\n\n We want to unroll the kernel loops for performance because kernel_size is small (like 3, 5, etc.). Therefore, we must pass `kernel_size` as a `tl.constexpr`.\n\n Also note: the `forward` function in the module uses `self.kernel_size` which is an integer. We can pass it as a constant to the kernel.\n\n Let's adjust the kernel signature and the call site.\n\n In the kernel:\n   Instead of:\n        kernel_size, stride, padding, dilation,\n   We mark kernel_size as constexpr and also we note that the other parameters (stride, padding, dilation) are used in the loop and condition, but they are not required to be constexpr for the loop unrolling? So we leave them as regular.\n\n But wait: the condition `cond = (h_in_coord % 1 == 0) ...` uses `stride` in a floating point division. We should change the approach to integer arithmetic to avoid precision issues and to allow for constexpr propagation.\n\n However, for the purpose of fixing the compilation error, we focus on the loop.\n\n Proposed changes:\n   - Change the kernel signature for `kernel_size` to be a `tl.constexpr`.\n   - Change the loops from `tl.static_range(kernel_size)` to `range(kernel_size)`.\n\n Also, we note that the condition using `cond` (checking that the coordinate is integer) might be too strict due to floating point precision. Instead, we can use integer arithmetic to avoid floating point.\n\n Alternative approach (for correctness and performance):\n   Instead of computing the input coordinates as floats and then checking if they are integers, we can use integer arithmetic to compute the input indices.\n\n   The formula for the input coordinate in a transposed convolution is:\n        input_coord = (output_coord + padding - kernel_index * dilation) / stride\n\n   But note: we are going backwards (from output to input). We want to know if there exists an integer input coordinate that contributes.\n\n   Actually, the condition for an input pixel (i, j) to contribute to the output pixel (h, w) is:\n        h = (i * stride) + kh * dilation - padding\n        w = (j * stride) + kw * dilation - padding\n\n   But in our kernel, we are iterating over the output pixel (h, w) and the kernel (kh, kw) and trying to find the input pixel (i, j) such that:\n        i = (h + padding - kh * dilation) / stride\n        j = (w + padding - kw * dilation) / stride\n\n   And we require that i and j are integers and within bounds.\n\n   We can rewrite without floating point by:\n        remainder_h = (h + padding - kh * dilation) % stride\n        remainder_w = (w + padding - kw * dilation) % stride\n        cond = (remainder_h == 0) and (remainder_w == 0)\n\n   Then:\n        i = (h + padding - kh * dilation) // stride\n        j = (w + padding - kw * dilation) // stride\n\n   But note: we must also check that (h + padding - kh * dilation) >=0 and similarly for w.\n\n   This integer method is more efficient and avoids floating point inaccuracies.\n\n   Therefore, we can change the condition to use integer remainders.\n\n   Steps for the kernel:\n        h_in_coord = h + padding - kh * dilation\n        w_in_coord = w + padding - kw * dilation\n\n        cond_h = (h_in_coord >= 0) & (h_in_coord % stride == 0)\n        cond_w = (w_in_coord >= 0) & (w_in_coord % stride == 0)\n        cond = cond_h & cond_w\n\n        i = tl.where(cond_h, h_in_coord // stride, -1)   # if condition fails, set to -1 (out of bounds)\n        j = tl.where(cond_w, w_in_coord // stride, -1)\n\n        in_bounds = (i >= 0) & (i < h_in) & (j >= 0) & (j < w_in) & cond\n\n   Then use `in_bounds` as the condition for loading.\n\n   However, note: the `stride` might not be a constexpr? But we are using it in modulo and division. We can pass `stride` as a constexpr as well? Or we can use the integer arithmetic without constexpr.\n\n   But the modulo and division operations are expensive? And we are inside a triple loop. We want to avoid heavy operations.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the integer expressions.\n\n   However, the problem is that we cannot use `%` and `//` for dynamic integers? Actually, we can. Triton supports these operations.\n\n   But note: the original approach using floating point might be less efficient and prone to precision issues.\n\n   We decide to change to integer arithmetic for correctness and efficiency.\n\n   So the plan:\n      1. Change the kernel_size to be a constexpr.\n      2. Change the loops to use `range(kernel_size)` (which will be unrolled because kernel_size is constexpr).\n      3. Replace the floating point coordinate calculation with integer arithmetic.\n\n   Also note: the current kernel uses `tl.math.floor` and a condition on modulo 1. We replace that.\n\n   Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n   Additionally, we note that the current kernel uses `tl.static_range` for two loops. We change both.\n\n   We also note that the kernel currently uses:\n        h_in_coord = (h + padding - kh * dilation) / stride\n        w_in_coord = ... \n\n   We replace with:\n        h_in_coord_val = h + padding - kh * dilation\n        w_in_coord_val = w + padding - kw * dilation\n\n        cond_h = (h_in_coord_val >= 0) & (h_in_coord_val % stride == 0)\n        cond_w = (w_in_coord_val >= 0) & (w_in_coord_val % stride == 0)\n\n        i = tl.where(cond_h, h_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n        j = tl.where(cond_w, w_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n\n        in_bounds = (i >= 0) & (i < h_in) & (j >= 0) & (j < w_in) & cond_h & cond_w\n\n   We then use `i` and `j` as integer indices.\n\n   We must be cautious: the division here is integer division (which is what we want).\n\n   Also note: we are using `stride` as an integer. The stride is provided as an integer in the module.\n\n   We must pass `stride` as an integer to the kernel. We are already passing it.\n\n   But note: the kernel parameters `stride`, `padding`, `dilation` are integers. We are using them in integer arithmetic.\n\n   Now, we must change the kernel signature to mark `kernel_size` as constexpr.\n\n   Also, note that the call site in the forward function passes `self.kernel_size` (an integer) to the kernel. This is acceptable because when we mark it as constexpr, Triton will use the constant value at compile time.\n\n   We also change the loops to `for kh in range(kernel_size)` and `for kw in range(kernel_size)`.\n\n   Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n   Additionally, we note that the current kernel uses `mask` in the load for the weight. But the weight mask should not depend on `in_bounds` because the weight is the same for all positions. However, we are loading the weight for a specific (c_in, c_out, kh, kw). We should load it with the same mask as the output element? Actually, the weight offset is independent of the spatial position. But note: the weight is of shape [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size]. We are loading one weight value per (c_in, c_out, kh, kw). The mask for the weight load should be the same as the block mask? But note: the weight is the same for all batches and spatial positions.\n\n   However, in the current code, the weight load uses `mask=mask` (the block mask). That is correct because we are only computing for the active block elements.\n\n   But wait: the weight is shared across all spatial positions. We are loading the same weight value for all elements in the block? That is inefficient. We should load the weight once per block and then broadcast. But that is a performance optimization we can do later.\n\n   For now, we focus on correctness and compilation.\n\n   We also note that the current kernel has a potential issue with the weight offset:\n\n        weight_offset = c_in * stride_wic + c_out * stride_woc + kh * stride_wh + kw * stride_ww\n\n   But note: the weight tensor is of shape [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size]. The strides passed are from the weight tensor. The weight tensor is contiguous? In the forward function, we do not explicitly make it contiguous. But in the test code, we don't see the weight being non-contiguous. However, it is safer to make the weight contiguous in the forward function.\n\n   But the original code does not make the weight contiguous. We will leave it for now.\n\n   Let's rewrite the kernel with the changes:\n\n        @triton.jit\n        def _conv_transpose2d_kernel(\n            ...,\n            kernel_size: tl.constexpr,   # mark kernel_size as constexpr\n            stride, padding, dilation,\n            BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr\n        ):\n            ...\n            for c_in in range(in_channels):\n                for kh in range(kernel_size):   # now using range on constexpr -> unrolled\n                    for kw in range(kernel_size):\n                        h_in_coord_val = h + padding - kh * dilation\n                        w_in_coord_val = w + padding - kw * dilation\n\n                        cond_h = (h_in_coord_val >= 0) & ((h_in_coord_val % stride) == 0)\n                        cond_w = (w_in_coord_val >= 0) & ((w_in_coord_val % stride) == 0)\n\n                        i = tl.where(cond_h, h_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n                        j = tl.where(cond_w, w_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n\n                        in_bounds = (i >= 0) & (i < h_in) & (j >= 0) & (j < w_in) & cond_h & cond_w\n\n                        # Then compute the offsets and load\n\n   However, note: `h` and `w` are vectors of size BLOCK_SIZE. We are doing these operations element-wise.\n\n   Also note: `h_in_coord_val` and `w_in_coord_val` are vectors. The condition and division are element-wise.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   But we must be cautious: the modulus and division operations are done element-wise.\n\n   We are now passing `kernel_size` as a constexpr. We must change the call site to pass it as a positional argument? Actually, Triton allows passing by name. We are passing by name in the call.\n\n   In the forward function:\n\n        _conv_transpose2d_kernel[grid](\n            ...,\n            kernel_size=self.kernel_size,   # now passed as a constexpr\n            ... \n        )\n\n   We are passing the same integer as before, but now the kernel expects it as a constexpr.\n\n   Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n   We also note that the current kernel has a problem in the weight offset: the weight tensor is of shape [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size]. The stride for the weight is computed as:\n\n        stride_wic, stride_woc, stride_wh, stride_ww = self.weight.stride()\n\n   But note: the weight is stored as (in_channels, out_channels, ...). The stride for the input channel dimension is stride_wic and for the output channel dimension is stride_woc. However, in the kernel we are using:\n\n        weight_offset = c_in * stride_wic + c_out * stride_woc + kh * stride_wh + kw * stride_ww\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   We are ready to rewrite.\n\n   However, note: the current program has the kernel inside the class `ModelNew`. We are going to keep the same structure.\n\n   We also note that the test code at the bottom must be preserved.\n\n   We will rewrite the kernel function and adjust the call in the forward function to pass `kernel_size` as a constexpr (by just passing the integer, and the kernel signature will mark it as constexpr).\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: We are only allowed to output the code block between EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and EVOLVE-BLOCK-END.\n\n   We are going to change the kernel and the kernel signature.\n\n   We also note that the integer arithmetic might be more efficient and avoid the floating point inaccuracies that could cause the condition to fail.\n\n   We hope this will fix the compilation and also the correctness.\n\n   Let's output the entire block with the changes.\n\n   Note: We are changing the kernel and the kernel signature. The call site in the forward function remains the same because we are passing the same arguments by name.\n\n   But note: in the call site, we pass `self.kernel_size` and in the kernel we now mark it as `tl.constexpr`. This is acceptable.\n\n   We also note that the other parameters (stride, padding, dilation) are still passed as integers (non-constexpr). That is acceptable because we are not using them in a context that requires constexpr (like static_range or as loop bounds).\n\n   However, we are using them in modulo and division. Triton supports that for dynamic integers.\n\n   We output the code accordingly.\n</think>\nThe error occurs because `tl.static_range` requires a compile-time constant (`constexpr`), but `kernel_size` is passed as a regular integer. The solution involves:\n\n1. Changing kernel loops to use `range(kernel_size)` instead of `tl.static_range`\n2. Using integer arithmetic for input coordinate calculations\n3. Adding proper masking for all tensor loads\n4.

dtype with row-wise granularity into a Triton implementation: \nThe original PyTorch implementation is as follows: \n``` \nimport torch\ndef per_row_quantize_int8(x: torch.Tensor) -> tuple[torch.Tensor, torch.Tensor]:\n    x_amax = x.abs().float().amax(dim=1).clamp(min=1e-4)\n    scale = 127 / x_amax\n    output = (x * scale[:, None]).round().clamp(-127, 127).to(torch.int8)\n    output_scale = x_amax / 127\n\n    return output, output_scale\n``` \nThe corresponding Triton-rewritten implementation is as follows: \n``` \nimport math\nimport torch\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\nfrom triton.language.extra import libdevice\n\n# rowwise quantize\n\n@triton.autotune(\n    configs=[\n        triton.Config({}, num_stages=1, num_warps=8),\n

(also known as deconvolution).\n The current kernel fails to compile because of the use of `tl.static_range` with a non-constexpr value.\n\n The error message is:\n   AssertionError: int32[] used as tl.static_range start value is not a constexpr\n\n The problem is that `kernel_size` is passed as a regular integer (not a `tl.constexpr`) and then used in `tl.static_range(kernel_size)`.\n\n We note that:\n   - The kernel uses `tl.static_range` for the kernel loops (kh and kw). This requires that the range must be known at compile time (i.e., a constexpr).\n   - However, the kernel_size is passed as a regular argument (which is not a constexpr) and hence cannot be used in `tl.static_range`.\n\n Solution:\n   We must change the loops over `kh` and `kw` to use regular Python `range` (which will be unrolled at compile time if the kernel_size is known) or use `tl.range` (which is a dynamic loop). However, note that the kernel size might be dynamic? But in our case, the kernel size is fixed for the layer.\n\n Since the kernel size is fixed for the module (it is provided at module initialization and does not change), we can pass it as a `tl.constexpr` to the kernel.\n\n However, in the current code, the kernel_size is passed as a regular argument. We need to change the kernel signature to mark `kernel_size` as a `tl.constexpr`.\n\n Steps:\n   1. In the kernel signature, change the parameter `kernel_size` to be a `tl.constexpr`.\n   2. Similarly, we can mark `stride`, `padding`, `dilation` as constexpr if they are used in ways that require compile-time constants? But note the error only occurs for `static_range`.\n\n But note: the current kernel also uses `stride` in a division which is floating point. That might be problematic for integer arithmetic? We are going to change the approach to integer arithmetic as well to avoid floating point conditions.\n\n However, the immediate problem is the use of `tl.static_range` with a non-constexpr. Let's change the loops to use `range` (which in Triton is unrolled if the argument is a constexpr). But note: in Triton, `for i in range(n)` will unroll the loop if `n` is a constexpr, otherwise it will be a dynamic loop.\n\n We want to unroll the kernel loops for performance because kernel_size is small (like 3, 5, etc.). Therefore, we must pass `kernel_size` as a `tl.constexpr`.\n\n Also note: the `forward` function in the module uses `self.kernel_size` which is an integer. We can pass it as a constant to the kernel.\n\n Let's adjust the kernel signature and the call site.\n\n In the kernel:\n   Instead of:\n        kernel_size, stride, padding, dilation,\n   We mark kernel_size as constexpr and also we note that the other parameters (stride, padding, dilation) are used in the loop and condition, but they are not required to be constexpr for the loop unrolling? So we leave them as regular.\n\n But wait: the condition `cond = (h_in_coord % 1 == 0) ...` uses `stride` in a floating point division. We should change the approach to integer arithmetic to avoid precision issues and to allow for constexpr propagation.\n\n However, for the purpose of fixing the compilation error, we focus on the loop.\n\n Proposed changes:\n   - Change the kernel signature for `kernel_size` to be a `tl.constexpr`.\n   - Change the loops from `tl.static_range(kernel_size)` to `range(kernel_size)`.\n\n Also, we note that the condition using `cond` (checking that the coordinate is integer) might be too strict due to floating point precision. Instead, we can use integer arithmetic to avoid floating point.\n\n Alternative approach (for correctness and performance):\n   Instead of computing the input coordinates as floats and then checking if they are integers, we can use integer arithmetic to compute the input indices.\n\n   The formula for the input coordinate in a transposed convolution is:\n        input_coord = (output_coord + padding - kernel_index * dilation) / stride\n\n   But note: we are going backwards (from output to input). We want to know if there exists an integer input coordinate that contributes.\n\n   Actually, the condition for an input pixel (i, j) to contribute to the output pixel (h, w) is:\n        h = (i * stride) + kh * dilation - padding\n        w = (j * stride) + kw * dilation - padding\n\n   But in our kernel, we are iterating over the output pixel (h, w) and the kernel (kh, kw) and trying to find the input pixel (i, j) such that:\n        i = (h + padding - kh * dilation) / stride\n        j = (w + padding - kw * dilation) / stride\n\n   And we require that i and j are integers and within bounds.\n\n   We can rewrite without floating point by:\n        remainder_h = (h + padding - kh * dilation) % stride\n        remainder_w = (w + padding - kw * dilation) % stride\n        cond = (remainder_h == 0) and (remainder_w == 0)\n\n   Then:\n        i = (h + padding - kh * dilation) // stride\n        j = (w + padding - kw * dilation) // stride\n\n   But note: we must also check that (h + padding - kh * dilation) >=0 and similarly for w.\n\n   This integer method is more efficient and avoids floating point inaccuracies.\n\n   Therefore, we can change the condition to use integer remainders.\n\n   Steps for the kernel:\n        h_in_coord = h + padding - kh * dilation\n        w_in_coord = w + padding - kw * dilation\n\n        cond_h = (h_in_coord >= 0) & (h_in_coord % stride == 0)\n        cond_w = (w_in_coord >= 0) & (w_in_coord % stride == 0)\n        cond = cond_h & cond_w\n\n        i = tl.where(cond_h, h_in_coord // stride, -1)   # if condition fails, set to -1 (out of bounds)\n        j = tl.where(cond_w, w_in_coord // stride, -1)\n\n        in_bounds = (i >= 0) & (i < h_in) & (j >= 0) & (j < w_in) & cond\n\n   Then use `in_bounds` as the condition for loading.\n\n   However, note: the `stride` might not be a constexpr? But we are using it in modulo and division. We can pass `stride` as a constexpr as well? Or we can use the integer arithmetic without constexpr.\n\n   But the modulo and division operations are expensive? And we are inside a triple loop. We want to avoid heavy operations.\n\n   Alternatively, we can precompute the integer expressions.\n\n   However, the problem is that we cannot use `%` and `//` for dynamic integers? Actually, we can. Triton supports these operations.\n\n   But note: the original approach using floating point might be less efficient and prone to precision issues.\n\n   We decide to change to integer arithmetic for correctness and efficiency.\n\n   So the plan:\n      1. Change the kernel_size to be a constexpr.\n      2. Change the loops to use `range(kernel_size)` (which will be unrolled because kernel_size is constexpr).\n      3. Replace the floating point coordinate calculation with integer arithmetic.\n\n   Also note: the current kernel uses `tl.math.floor` and a condition on modulo 1. We replace that.\n\n   Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n   Additionally, we note that the current kernel uses `tl.static_range` for two loops. We change both.\n\n   We also note that the kernel currently uses:\n        h_in_coord = (h + padding - kh * dilation) / stride\n        w_in_coord = ... \n\n   We replace with:\n        h_in_coord_val = h + padding - kh * dilation\n        w_in_coord_val = w + padding - kw * dilation\n\n        cond_h = (h_in_coord_val >= 0) & (h_in_coord_val % stride == 0)\n        cond_w = (w_in_coord_val >= 0) & (w_in_coord_val % stride == 0)\n\n        i = tl.where(cond_h, h_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n        j = tl.where(cond_w, w_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n\n        in_bounds = (i >= 0) & (i < h_in) & (j >= 0) & (j < w_in) & cond_h & cond_w\n\n   We then use `i` and `j` as integer indices.\n\n   We must be cautious: the division here is integer division (which is what we want).\n\n   Also note: we are using `stride` as an integer. The stride is provided as an integer in the module.\n\n   We must pass `stride` as an integer to the kernel. We are already passing it.\n\n   But note: the kernel parameters `stride`, `padding`, `dilation` are integers. We are using them in integer arithmetic.\n\n   Now, we must change the kernel signature to mark `kernel_size` as constexpr.\n\n   Also, note that the call site in the forward function passes `self.kernel_size` (an integer) to the kernel. This is acceptable because when we mark it as constexpr, Triton will use the constant value at compile time.\n\n   We also change the loops to `for kh in range(kernel_size)` and `for kw in range(kernel_size)`.\n\n   Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n   Additionally, we note that the current kernel uses `mask` in the load for the weight. But the weight mask should not depend on `in_bounds` because the weight is the same for all positions. However, we are loading the weight for a specific (c_in, c_out, kh, kw). We should load it with the same mask as the output element? Actually, the weight offset is independent of the spatial position. But note: the weight is of shape [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size]. We are loading one weight value per (c_in, c_out, kh, kw). The mask for the weight load should be the same as the block mask? But note: the weight is the same for all batches and spatial positions.\n\n   However, in the current code, the weight load uses `mask=mask` (the block mask). That is correct because we are only computing for the active block elements.\n\n   But wait: the weight is shared across all spatial positions. We are loading the same weight value for all elements in the block? That is inefficient. We should load the weight once per block and then broadcast. But that is a performance optimization we can do later.\n\n   For now, we focus on correctness and compilation.\n\n   We also note that the current kernel has a potential issue with the weight offset:\n\n        weight_offset = c_in * stride_wic + c_out * stride_woc + kh * stride_wh + kw * stride_ww\n\n   But note: the weight tensor is of shape [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size]. The strides passed are from the weight tensor. The weight tensor is contiguous? In the forward function, we do not explicitly make it contiguous. But in the test code, we don't see the weight being non-contiguous. However, it is safer to make the weight contiguous in the forward function.\n\n   But the original code does not make the weight contiguous. We will leave it for now.\n\n   Let's rewrite the kernel with the changes:\n\n        @triton.jit\n        def _conv_transpose2d_kernel(\n            ...,\n            kernel_size: tl.constexpr,   # mark kernel_size as constexpr\n            stride, padding, dilation,\n            BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr\n        ):\n            ...\n            for c_in in range(in_channels):\n                for kh in range(kernel_size):   # now using range on constexpr -> unrolled\n                    for kw in range(kernel_size):\n                        h_in_coord_val = h + padding - kh * dilation\n                        w_in_coord_val = w + padding - kw * dilation\n\n                        cond_h = (h_in_coord_val >= 0) & ((h_in_coord_val % stride) == 0)\n                        cond_w = (w_in_coord_val >= 0) & ((w_in_coord_val % stride) == 0)\n\n                        i = tl.where(cond_h, h_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n                        j = tl.where(cond_w, w_in_coord_val // stride, -1)\n\n                        in_bounds = (i >= 0) & (i < h_in) & (j >= 0) & (j < w_in) & cond_h & cond_w\n\n                        # Then compute the offsets and load\n\n   However, note: `h` and `w` are vectors of size BLOCK_SIZE. We are doing these operations element-wise.\n\n   Also note: `h_in_coord_val` and `w_in_coord_val` are vectors. The condition and division are element-wise.\n\n   This should work.\n\n   But we must be cautious: the modulus and division operations are done element-wise.\n\n   We are now passing `kernel_size` as a constexpr. We must change the call site to pass it as a positional argument? Actually, Triton allows passing by name. We are passing by name in the call.\n\n   In the forward function:\n\n        _conv_transpose2d_kernel[grid](\n            ...,\n            kernel_size=self.kernel_size,   # now passed as a constexpr\n            ... \n        )\n\n   We are passing the same integer as before, but now the kernel expects it as a constexpr.\n\n   Let's update the kernel accordingly.\n\n   We also note that the current kernel has a problem in the weight offset: the weight tensor is of shape [in_channels, out_channels, kernel_size, kernel_size]. The stride for the weight is computed as:\n\n        stride_wic, stride_woc, stride_wh, stride_ww = self.weight.stride()\n\n   But note: the weight is stored as (in_channels, out_channels, ...). The stride for the input channel dimension is stride_wic and for the output channel dimension is stride_woc. However, in the kernel we are using:\n\n        weight_offset = c_in * stride_wic + c_out * stride_woc + kh * stride_wh + kw * stride_ww\n\n   This is correct.\n\n   We are ready to rewrite.\n\n   However, note: the current program has the kernel inside the class `ModelNew`. We are going to keep the same structure.\n\n   We also note that the test code at the bottom must be preserved.\n\n   We will rewrite the kernel function and adjust the call in the forward function to pass `kernel_size` as a constexpr (by just passing the integer, and the kernel signature will mark it as constexpr).\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: We are only allowed to output the code block between EVOLVE-BLOCK-START and EVOLVE-BLOCK-END.\n\n   We are going to change the kernel and the kernel signature.\n\n   We also note that the integer arithmetic might be more efficient and avoid the floating point inaccuracies that could cause the condition to fail.\n\n   We hope this will fix the compilation and also the correctness.\n\n   Let's output the entire block with the changes.\n\n   Note: We are changing the kernel and the kernel signature. The call site in the forward function remains the same because we are passing the same arguments by name.\n\n   But note: in the call site, we pass `self.kernel_size` and in the kernel we now mark it as `tl.constexpr`. This is acceptable.\n\n   We also note that the other parameters (stride, padding, dilation) are still passed as integers (non-constexpr). That is acceptable because we are not using them in a context that requires constexpr (like static_range or as loop bounds).\n\n   However, we are using them in modulo and division. Triton supports that for dynamic integers.\n\n   We output the code accordingly.\n</think>\nThe error occurs because `tl.static_range` requires a compile-time constant (`constexpr`), but `kernel_size` is passed as a regular integer.

We note that the operation is a matrix-vector multiplication. This is a reduction over K for each row of A.\n 2. We can write a Triton kernel that processes each row independently (each program ID along M).\n 3. We will use a block size that is a power of two and as large as possible (but <= K) for each row.\n    However, note that K is 131072 which is large. We can process the row in chunks and accumulate.\n 4. We must be cautious about the grid: we have M rows, so the grid will be (M,).\n 5. We must handle the case when K is not a multiple of the block size.\n\n Plan for the Triton kernel:\n   - pid = program_id(0)  [0 to M-1]\n   - We will have a BLOCK_SIZE for the reduction dimension (K). We choose a block size (e.g., 1024, 2048, etc.) that is a power of two and large enough to reduce the number of steps.\n   - We precompute the pointer to the row in A: A_row = A + pid * stride_am + ... (using strides)\n   - We initialize an accumulator to zero.\n   - We loop over the columns of the row in chunks of BLOCK_SIZE.\n   - For each chunk, we load a block from A_row and the corresponding block from B (which is a vector).\n   - We compute the dot product of the chunk and accumulate.\n   - After the loop, we write the accumulator to the output at position pid.\n\n Constraints:\n   - We must not change the function signature of the forward method. We will replace the torch.matmul with a call to our Triton kernel.\n\n Implementation details:\n   - We will create a Triton kernel function.\n   - We will determine an appropriate block size (BLOCK_K) for the reduction. We can make it configurable via autotune.\n   - We note that B is a vector of shape (K, 1). We can treat it as a contiguous vector.\n\n Important: The inputs A and B are provided as [M, K] and [K, 1] respectively.\n\n Steps in the kernel:\n   pid = tl.program_id(0)\n   offs_k = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K)\n   a_ptrs = A + pid * stride_am + offs_k\n   b_ptrs = B + offs_k   # because B is [K,1] and we are taking the first (and only) column.\n\n   However, note: we are going to loop over the entire K dimension. We cannot load the whole row at once because K is too big.\n\n   We do:\n   accumulator = 0.0\n   for k in range(0, K, BLOCK_K):\n        k_offs = k + offs_k\n        mask = k_offs < K   # to avoid out-of-bounds\n        a = tl.load(a_ptrs + k, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n        b = tl.load(b_ptrs + k, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n        accumulator += tl.sum(a * b)\n\n   Then store the accumulator at output[pid].\n\n But note: the above loop does a dot product per block and then sums the results. However, note that the entire dot product is the sum of the products of the entire row and vector.\n\n However, we are accumulating the sum of products for the entire row. This is correct.\n\n But note: the problem is that we are doing a reduction across the entire row. The above loop does:\n   accumulator = a0*b0 + a1*b1 + ... \n\n However, the inner product is the sum of the products. So we can do:\n   accumulator = tl.sum(a * b)  for the block and then add to the accumulator.\n\n But note: tl.sum is a reduction within the block. Then we do a scalar accumulation across blocks. This is acceptable.\n\n But we must be cautious: the reduction in the block is done in parallel, but the scalar accumulation is per program (so no issue).\n\n However, we can also do:\n   We can avoid the inner block reduction and do a single scalar accumulation per element and then reduce at the end? \n   Actually, we are accumulating the entire row. We can do:\n\n   accumulator_block = 0.0\n   for ...:\n        a = ...\n        b = ...\n        accumulator_block += a * b   # element-wise\n\n   Then we do: accumulator = tl.sum(accumulator_block, axis=0)\n\n   But note: we cannot do that because accumulator_block would be a vector of BLOCK_K and we are storing it in a register? \n   Alternatively, we can do:\n\n   We can have a register to hold the current accumulator (a scalar) and then use tl.sum on the chunk to add to the scalar.\n\n   Option 1 (as above):\n        chunk = tl.load(...) * tl.load(...)\n        accumulator += tl.sum(chunk, axis=0)\n\n   Option 2: use a single accumulator and do a dot product without storing the entire vector? Actually, we can use tl.dot but note that the shapes are 1D and 1D, which is a dot product. However, we are already loading the entire block. We can do:\n\n        a = tl.load(a_ptrs + k, mask=mask)\n        b = tl.load(b_ptrs + k, mask=mask)\n        accumulator += tl.sum(a * b)   # this is the same as tl.dot(a, b) but without the need for contiguous? \n\n   But note: tl.dot requires that the two vectors are contiguous and in the same dtype? And it uses tensor cores? However, we are in fp32? The problem doesn't specify the dtype. The inputs are from `torch.randn` which are fp32.\n\n   We cannot use tensor cores for fp32? Actually, we can use tf32, but we are not sure. And the block size might not be aligned for tensor cores.\n\n   Since the problem is a reduction over a large dimension, we want to minimize the number of operations. The inner loop should be efficient.\n\n   We note that the current approach (using a scalar accumulator and adding the sum of the chunk) is straightforward.\n\n   However, we can use tl.reduce to do the reduction in the chunk without having to store the entire chunk? Actually, we are loading the chunk anyway.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        a = tl.load(...)\n        b = tl.load(...)\n        chunk = a * b\n        chunk_sum = tl.sum(chunk, axis=0)   # this is a scalar\n        accumulator += chunk_sum\n\n   This is efficient.\n\n 6. We must set the grid and block for the kernel. The grid will be (M,). The block will be 1 (since we are processing one row per program) but we use a 1D block of size BLOCK_K for the reduction? Actually, no: the kernel is written to use a 1D grid of M, and within each program we use a loop over K with step BLOCK_K. The block of threads (in the CUDA sense) is not directly exposed in Triton in the same way. Instead, we use the `BLOCK_K` as the number of elements we process in one step.\n\n 7. We note that the kernel must be jit compiled and we can autotune the BLOCK_K.\n\n 8. We must handle the data types: the input tensors are fp32 (from torch.randn). The output must be fp32.\n\n 9. We must check boundaries for each load.\n\n Implementation:\n\n   Let's define the kernel:\n\n   @triton.jit\n   def _matvec_kernel(\n        A_ptr, B_ptr, C_ptr,\n        M, K,\n        stride_am, stride_ak,   # strides for A: [M, K] -> A[0,0] to A[0,1] is stride_ak, A[0,0] to A[1,0] is stride_am\n        stride_bk, stride_b1,   # B: [K, 1] -> stride from row to row is stride_bk, and the next element in the same row? but there is only one column -> so stride for column is stride_b1 (which is 1? but we don't use it because we are only loading the first column). Actually, we can ignore the second dimension.\n        stride_cm,             # C: [M, 1] -> stride for rows is stride_cm, and the column stride is 1? but we only have one column per row.\n        BLOCK_K: tl.constexpr,\n   ):\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        if pid >= M:\n            return\n\n        # Pointers for the row in A and the output\n        offs_m = pid\n        c_ptr = C_ptr + offs_m * stride_cm   # output is [M,1] so we write one element per row.\n\n        # We are going to loop over the columns (K dimension) in blocks of BLOCK_K\n        accumulator = 0.0\n        for k in range(0, K, BLOCK_K):\n            offs_k = k + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K)\n            mask = offs_k < K\n\n            # Load A: [pid, offs_k]\n            a_ptr = A_ptr + offs_m * stride_am + offs_k * stride_ak\n            a = tl.load(a_ptr, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n            # Load B: [offs_k, 0]  -> because B is (K,1)\n            b_ptr = B_ptr + offs_k * stride_bk   # note: stride_bk is the stride for the rows of B (which is the first dimension). The second dimension has stride 1 but we are not using it because we only have one column.\n            b = tl.load(b_ptr, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n            # Compute the product and accumulate\n            product = a * b\n            accumulator += tl.sum(product, axis=0)\n\n        tl.store(c_ptr, accumulator)\n\n 10. In the forward function, we will call this kernel.\n\n 11. We must set the grid: (M,). We must choose BLOCK_K. We can set it to a fixed value (like 1024) or use autotune.\n\n 12. We note that the tensor B is of shape (K, 1). Its stride for the first dimension (rows) is either 1 (if contiguous) or something else. We should get the stride.\n\n 13. We assume the inputs are contiguous. But we can use the strides.\n\n 14. Steps in the forward function:\n        M, K = A.shape\n        # Check B shape: (K, 1)\n        assert B.shape == (K, 1), \"B must be of shape (K, 1)\"\n        C = torch.empty((M, 1), device=A.device, dtype=A.dtype)\n\n        # If M is 0, return C\n        if M == 0:\n            return C\n\n        # We can choose a block size. We can try to set it to a power of two, and as large as possible but not too big (to avoid too many registers?).\n        # We set BLOCK_K = 1024 for now. But we can autotune.\n\n        grid = (M,)\n        # Strides:\n        stride_am, stride_ak = A.stride()\n        stride_bk, stride_b1 = B.stride()\n        stride_cm, stride_c1 = C.stride()\n\n        # We call the kernel\n        _matvec_kernel[grid](A, B, C, M, K, stride_am, stride_ak, stride_bk, stride_b1, stride_cm, BLOCK_K=1024)\n\n        return C\n\n 15. We must import triton and tl.\n\n 16. We note that the kernel must be compiled and we are using Triton.\n\n 17. We can try to autotune the BLOCK_K? But the problem says to do iterative steps. We can start with a fixed block size and then in the next evolution we can autotune.\n\n 18. We note that the current torch.matmul is highly optimized. We need to make sure our Triton kernel is faster.\n\n 19. Potential optimizations:\n      - Use fp16 or tensor cores? But the problem does not specify the dtype. The input is fp32. We can convert to fp16? But that would change the result. We must be numerically equivalent. So we stick to fp32.\n      - We can use multiple warps per row? But each row is independent and we are already using a loop. The kernel is designed for one row per program. We can use multiple threads per row? But that would require a parallel reduction within the row. Currently, we are doing the reduction sequentially (with a loop over blocks and then a reduction per block). This might be efficient if BLOCK_K is large enough to hide latency.\n\n 20. We choose BLOCK_K=2048 to reduce the number of steps (since K=131072, we would have 131072/2048=64 steps). This might be acceptable.\n\n 21. We must test for correctness.\n\n Given the constraints, we output the code accordingly.\n\n Let's write the code:\n\n Note: We are replacing the entire EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n We are going to define the kernel inside the ModelNew class? Actually, we can define it outside the class.\n\n We structure:\n\n   import triton\n   import triton.language as tl\n\n   @triton.jit\n   def _matvec_kernel(...):\n        ...\n\n   class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        def forward(...):\n            ... (call the kernel)\n\n   M = 256\n   K = 131072\n\n   ... (get_inputs, etc.)\n\n However, note: the problem says to rewrite the program. We are allowed to change the forward method.\n\n But note: the original code had no Triton. We are introducing it.\n\n We must be cautious: the inputs are on GPU? We assume they are.\n\n We will write the kernel and the call.\n\n Since the problem does not specify the device, we assume the inputs are on the same device as the kernel expects (we are using the same device for the output).\n\n Let's code accordingly.\n\n However, note: the current program does not have any Triton code. We are introducing Triton for the first time.\n\n We must check if the kernel is called with the correct grid and parameters.\n\n We note that the kernel uses a 1D grid of size M.\n\n We set the block size for the kernel? Actually, in Triton, the block size is determined by the kernel itself (the number of threads is not specified in the grid). We are using a loop over K with step BLOCK_K, but BLOCK_K is the number of elements we process at a time (it is not the number of threads). In fact, the kernel is executed by one thread? \n\n Actually, no: Triton kernels are executed by blocks of threads. We haven't specified the number of threads per block. In Triton, the kernel is written in a way that the entire block of threads is used for the vectorized loads and the reduction. But in our kernel, we are using:\n\n        offs_k = k + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K)\n\n This means that we are using BLOCK_K as the number of threads for the block? Actually, yes: the kernel will be launched with a block of BLOCK_K threads? But note: we are not using the block dimension in the program_id. We are only using the grid dimension (M). \n\n How do we set the number of threads per block? In Triton, the kernel launch uses a block of threads that is determined by the compiler. The BLOCK_K is a constant expression that tells the compiler to use a block of BLOCK_K threads? \n\n But note: we are using a 1D grid of M. The kernel is written for a 1D grid and a 1D block of size BLOCK_K? Actually, no: the kernel does not use the thread id. It uses tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K) to generate a vector of indices. This is a SIMD operation. The kernel is executed by one thread? \n\n Actually, in Triton, the kernel is executed by a block of threads that is abstracted away. The tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K) will generate a contiguous block of BLOCK_K elements that are processed in parallel. The compiler will map these to threads. So we are effectively using BLOCK_K threads per block? \n\n But note: the grid is (M,), and each program in the grid is a block of BLOCK_K threads? \n\n However, we are not using the thread id for the row. We are using the program_id(0) for the row. And then we are processing the entire row with a loop. The loop is over the K dimension in steps of BLOCK_K? Actually, no: we are processing a chunk of size BLOCK_K at a time. The tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K) is used to generate the offsets within the chunk.\n\n So the kernel will be launched with:\n   grid = (M,)\n   and the block size is BLOCK_K? \n\n How do we set the block size? In Triton, we set it via the launch configuration. But in our kernel, we are not specifying the block size explicitly. We are using BLOCK_K as a constexpr. The compiler will use BLOCK_K as the number of threads per block? \n\n Actually, the Triton compiler will infer the block size from the range of the first tl.arange. Since we have only one tl.arange (with size BLOCK_K), the block will be of size BLOCK_K.\n\n Therefore, we must choose BLOCK_K that is a power of two and within the hardware limits (e.g., 1024, 2048? but note that the maximum number of threads per block is 1024 for most GPUs). So we cannot set BLOCK_K=2048. We must set it to at most 1024.\n\n We change: BLOCK_K = min(1024, ...) but we set it to 1024.\n\n However, note: the H100 supports 1024 threads per block.\n\n So we set BLOCK_K=1024.\n\n But what if we want to use more than 1024? We cannot. So we break the K dimension into chunks of 1024.\n\n Since K=131072, we have 131072/1024 = 128 steps per row.\n\n This is acceptable.\n\n We write the kernel accordingly.\n\n Let's code.\n\n IMPORTANT: We must not change the get_inputs and get_init_inputs.\n\n We are replacing the forward method and adding the kernel.\n\n We note: the original code had M and K as global variables? But they are used in the get_inputs. We are not changing that.\n\n We are only changing the ModelNew class and adding the kernel.\n\n We must include the necessary imports.\n\n But note: the problem says to return only the EVOLVE-BLOCK. We must include the entire block.\n\n We write:\n\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef _matvec_kernel(\n    A_ptr, B_ptr, C_ptr,\n    M, K,\n    stride_am, stride_ak,\n    stride_bk, stride_b1,\n    stride_cm, stride_c1,\n    BLOCK_K: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(0)\n    if pid >= M:\n        return\n\n    # Pointers for the row in A and the output\n    offs_m = pid\n    c_ptr = C_ptr + offs_m * stride_cm\n\n    accumulator = 0.0\n    # Loop over K in blocks of BLOCK_K\n    for k in range(0, K, BLOCK_K):\n        offs_k = k + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K)\n        mask = offs_k < K\n\n        # Load A: [pid, offs_k]\n        a_ptr = A_ptr + offs_m * stride_am + offs_k * stride_ak\n        a = tl.load(a_ptr, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n        # Load B: [offs_k, 0] (since B is (K, 1))\n        b_ptr = B_ptr + offs_k * stride_bk\n        b = tl.load(b_ptr, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n        product = a * b\n        accumulator += tl.sum(product, axis=0)\n\n    tl.store(c_ptr, accumulator)\n\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    \"\"\"\n    Simple model that performs matrix-vector multiplication (C = A * B).\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n    \n    def forward(self, A: torch.Tensor, B: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        \"\"\"\n        Performs matrix-vector multiplication.\n\n        Args:\n            A: Input matrix of shape (M, K).\n            B: Input vector of shape (K, 1).\n\n        Returns:\n            Output vector of shape (M, 1).\n        \"\"\"\n        M, K = A.shape\n        # Check B shape\n        assert B.shape == (K, 1), f\"B must be of shape ({K}, 1), but got {B.shape}\"\n        C = torch.empty((M, 1), device=A.device, dtype=A.dtype)\n        if M == 0:\n            return C\n\n        # We use BLOCK_K = 1024\n        BLOCK_K = 1024\n        grid = (M,)\n        # Get strides\n        stride_am, stride_ak = A.stride()\n        stride_bk, stride_b1 = B.stride()\n        stride_cm, stride_c1 = C.stride()\n\n        # Launch kernel\n        _matvec_kernel[grid](\n            A, B, C,\n            M, K,\n            stride_am, stride_ak,\n            stride_bk, stride_b1,\n            stride_cm, stride_c1,\n            BLOCK_K=BLOCK_K\n        )\n        return C\n\nM = 256\nK = 131072\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    A = torch.randn(M, K)\n    B = torch.randn(K, 1)\n    return [A, B]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []  # No special initialization inputs needed\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n</think>\n```python\n\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef _matvec_kernel(\n    A_ptr, B_ptr, C_ptr,\n    M, K,\n    stride_am, stride_ak,\n    stride_bk, stride_b1,\n    stride_cm, stride_c1,\n    BLOCK_K: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(0)\n    if pid >= M:\n        return\n\n    offs_m = pid\n    c_ptr = C_ptr + offs_m * stride_cm\n\n    accumulator = 0.0\n    for k in range(0, K, BLOCK_K):\n        offs_k = k + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_K)\n        mask = offs_k < K\n\n        a_ptr = A_ptr + offs_m * stride_am + offs_k * stride_ak\n        a = tl.load(a_ptr, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n        b_ptr = B_ptr + offs_k * stride_bk\n        b = tl.load(b_ptr, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n        product = a * b\n        accumulator += tl.sum(product, axis=0)\n\n    tl.store(c_ptr, accumulator)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n    \n    def forward(self, A: torch.Tensor, B: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n        M, K = A.shape\n        assert B.shape == (K, 1), f\"B must be of shape ({K}, 1)\"\n        C = torch.empty((M, 1), device=A.device, dtype=A.dtype)\n        \n        if M == 0:\n            return C\n\n        BLOCK_K = 1024\n        grid = (M,)\n        stride_am, stride_ak = A.stride()\n        stride_bk, stride_b1 = B.stride()\n        stride_cm, stride_c1 = C.stride()\n\n        _matvec_kernel[grid](\n            A, B, C,\n            M, K,\n            stride_am, stride_ak,\n            stride_bk, stride_b1,\n            stride_cm, stride_c1,\n            BLOCK_K=BLOCK_K\n        )\n        return C\n\nM = 256\nK = 131072\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    A = torch.randn(M, K)\n    B = torch.randn(K, 1)\n    return [A, B]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

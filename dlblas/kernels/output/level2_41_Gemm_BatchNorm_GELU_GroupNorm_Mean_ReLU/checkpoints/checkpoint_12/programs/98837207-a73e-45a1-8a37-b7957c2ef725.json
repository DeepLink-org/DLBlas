ReLU\n\nThe goal is to rewrite the forward pass of the model using Triton to speed it up.\n\nHowever, note that the current implementation is entirely in PyTorch. We are allowed to replace parts with Triton kernels.\n\nBut note: The problem states that we are to generate Triton implementations for the kernels. However, the entire model is a sequence of operations. We cannot replace the entire model with one Triton kernel because it is too complex and the operations are sequential.\n\nBut note: The instructions say to generate Triton implementations (custom_code) for the reference_code. The reference_code in this case is the entire model.\n\nHowever, the evaluation pipeline requires that we have a function that can be verified for correctness and then executed for timing.\n\nLooking at the provided example (per_row_quantize_int8), we see that we are allowed to write a Triton kernel and then a wrapper function that uses that kernel.\n\nBut note: The problem says that we are to rewrite the model. The model is currently defined as an nn.Module.\n\nWe have two options:\n  1. Rewrite the entire forward pass as a single Triton kernel (if possible and beneficial)\n  2. Rewrite individual operations (like the GELU, or the GroupNorm) in Triton.\n\nHowever, the problem states: \"Generate functionally equivalent but faster Triton implementations (custom_code)\".\n\nGiven the complexity of the entire chain, it might be too much for a single kernel. Moreover, the operations are diverse.\n\nBut note: The current model is being timed as a whole. We are to speed up the entire forward pass.\n\nWe must be cautious: \n  - We cannot change the function signatures (the forward pass must take the same input and return the same output).\n  - We cannot change the grid configuration or the output tensor shapes.\n\nHowever, the current model does not have a Triton kernel at all. We are going to introduce one or more.\n\nGiven the constraints, we might focus on the most expensive operations. The GEMM is already handled by a highly optimized cuBLAS in nn.Linear. Similarly, BatchNorm and GroupNorm are optimized in PyTorch. The pointwise operations (GELU, ReLU) and the reduction (mean) are also optimized.\n\nBut note: The current model is running at 0.143 ms (custom_timing) and the reference timing is 0.119 ms? Actually, the meta says: \n  'reference_timing_ms': 0.119, 'speed_up': 0.832, 'custom_timing': 0.143\n\nWait: the speed_up is 0.832 (which is less than 1) meaning that the current custom implementation (which is the PyTorch one) is slower than the reference? That doesn't make sense because the reference is the same as the custom? \n\nActually, the problem states: the current program is the reference code. We are to replace it with a Triton version.\n\nSo the current program (the one we are to rewrite) is the reference. We are to create a custom version that is faster.\n\nBut note: the current program is a PyTorch model. We are to rewrite it to use Triton.\n\nHowever, the example we are given (per_row_quantize_int8) shows that we are allowed to write a kernel and then a function that uses that kernel.\n\nBut the model is an nn.Module. We can still use Triton inside the forward pass.\n\nLet's break down the operations:\n\n1. GEMM: We can replace with a Triton GEMM? But note that cuBLAS is very optimized. We might not beat it. But sometimes for specific sizes we can.\n\n2. BatchNorm: This is a pointwise operation and reduction. We can write a Triton kernel for batchnorm? But again, PyTorch's is optimized.\n\n3. GELU: pointwise, easy to write in Triton.\n\n4. GroupNorm: similar to batchnorm but per group. We can write a Triton kernel.\n\n5. Mean: reduction, we can write a Triton kernel.\n\n6. ReLU: pointwise.\n\nBut note: the entire chain might be memory bound. We are doing multiple passes over the data.\n\nWe might consider fusing operations. For example, we can fuse:\n  - GEMM + BatchNorm? (but BatchNorm requires statistics over the output of GEMM, so we have to compute the mean and variance for the entire batch? Actually, BatchNorm1d in PyTorch does: \n        y = (x - mean) / sqrt(var + eps) * weight + bias\n    We can compute the mean and variance in one pass and then do the normalization.\n\nBut note: the current model does:\n    x = self.gemm(x)   -> [batch_size, out_features]\n    x = self.batch_norm(x)  -> same shape\n\nThen we do GELU, then GroupNorm, then mean, then ReLU.\n\nWe cannot fuse everything because the GroupNorm and the mean are over different dimensions.\n\nHowever, we can try to fuse the pointwise operations (like GELU and ReLU) with the normalization steps? But note that the GroupNorm is a normalization that requires statistics per group.\n\nAlternatively, we can write a single kernel that does the entire forward pass? That would be very complex.\n\nGiven the constraints of the problem and the fact that we are to make small iterative steps, we might start by replacing one operation that we suspect is the bottleneck.\n\nBut note: the current runtime is very small (0.143 ms). We are on a very fast GPU. The problem says the hardware is H800 (same as H100). The operations are on a tensor of [128, 1024] (after the linear layer).\n\nWe must also note that the current model is defined with:\n    batch_size = 128\n    in_features = 512\n    out_features = 1024\n\nSo the linear layer: [128,512] * [512,1024] -> [128,1024]\n\nThe BatchNorm is on the 1024 features.\n\nThen GroupNorm: with num_groups=8, so the number of channels is 1024? Actually, GroupNorm divides the channels (the last dimension) into groups. Here, the input to group norm is [128,1024]? Then we must have 1024 channels? But note: the GroupNorm is defined as `nn.GroupNorm(num_groups, out_features)`. The `out_features` is 1024, and the number of groups is 8. So each group has 1024/8=128 channels.\n\nBut note: the GroupNorm expects the input to have at least 2 dimensions? Actually, the input to group norm is [batch_size, channels, ...]. Here we have [128, 1024] -> which is [batch_size, features]. So we have to reshape? Actually, the GroupNorm in PyTorch for 2D input (without channel dimension) expects the input to be [batch_size, channels]? But note: the GroupNorm documentation says:\n    Input: (N, C, *) where C = num_channels\n    Output: (N, C, *) (same shape as input)\n\nBut our input is [128, 1024] and we are treating it as 1024 channels? Then we have to add a dimension? Actually, no: the GroupNorm works on the channel dimension. In a 2D tensor, the channel dimension is the second one. So we have 1024 channels. Then the group norm will split the 1024 channels into 8 groups (each of 128 channels). Then it normalizes each group independently.\n\nThen we do: \n    torch.mean(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)  -> [128,1]\n\nThen ReLU.\n\nNow, the mean operation reduces the 1024 features to 1. Then ReLU is just on a scalar? Actually, the ReLU on a scalar that is non-negative? It might be a no-op if the mean is non-negative? But note: the mean of the normalized features might be negative? Actually, the GroupNorm normalizes each group to have zero mean? Then the overall mean might be zero? But then the ReLU(0)=0.\n\nBut note: the GroupNorm does not make the entire feature vector have zero mean? It normalizes each group independently. The mean over the entire feature vector might not be zero.\n\nBut anyway, the point is: the last two operations (mean and ReLU) are on a tensor that is [128,1]. That is very small. So they are cheap.\n\nSo the expensive operations are:\n  1. GEMM: 128*512*1024 FLOPs (about 67 million FLOPs)\n  2. BatchNorm: 128*1024*2 (for mean and variance) and then elementwise operations? Actually, the BatchNorm1d does:\n        - Compute mean and variance over the batch for each feature -> two reductions of size 128 (for each feature)\n        - Then normalize each feature.\n\n  3. GELU: 128*1024 elementwise operations (about 131 thousand operations)\n  4. GroupNorm: \n        - Reshape? Actually, no reshape needed? The GroupNorm for 2D input: \n            - It will split the 1024 features into 8 groups (each 128 features). Then for each group and each sample, it computes the mean and standard deviation over the 128 features? Then normalize.\n        - So for each sample and each group: \n            - 128 elements -> compute mean and variance (each 128 operations per group per sample) -> 8*128*128 operations? Actually, 8 groups and 128 samples? Wait, 128 samples and 8 groups -> 128*8 groups? So 128*8*128 = 131 thousand operations? Then the normalization is elementwise.\n\n  5. Mean: over 1024 features for each sample -> 128*1024 operations? Actually, 128*1024 = 131 thousand operations.\n\nBut note: the GEMM is by far the most expensive (67e6 FLOPs) and then the rest are 131 thousand operations? So the GEMM dominates.\n\nTherefore, if we want to speed up the entire model, we should focus on the GEMM.\n\nBut note: the current GEMM is done by cuBLAS. We are unlikely to beat cuBLAS with a Triton kernel for a standard GEMM? However, sometimes for specific sizes we can.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to fuse the GEMM with the subsequent operations? But the next operation is BatchNorm, which requires a reduction over the batch. We cannot fuse that with the GEMM without doing the reduction in the kernel? That would be a kernel that does the GEMM and then the BatchNorm? But that would require that we compute the mean and variance for the BatchNorm in the same kernel? That is possible.\n\nHowever, the problem says: \"Replace staged softmax with online/FlashAttention variants\" -> so we are allowed to fuse operations.\n\nBut note: the constraints say we cannot change the grid configuration? Actually, we are allowed to change the grid configuration? The constraints say:\n    \u274c NEVER change @triton.jit function signatures or parameter names\n    \u274c NEVER modify grid configuration, output tensor shapes, or PID logic\n\nWait: the grid configuration is the lambda we pass? We are allowed to change that? The constraint says \"NEVER modify grid configuration\", meaning we are not allowed to change it arbitrarily? But in the example, they did set the grid with a lambda.\n\nActually, the constraint says: \"NEVER modify grid configuration, output tensor shapes, or PID logic\" for the kernel that we are given? But in this case, we are writing the kernel from scratch.\n\nBut note: the current model does not have a Triton kernel. We are introducing one. So we have freedom? But the constraint says: \"NEVER change @triton.jit function signatures or parameter names\" -> meaning that if we are given a kernel with a signature, we cannot change it. But we are not given any kernel.\n\nAlternatively, the constraint might be for the kernels that we are replacing? We are replacing the entire model.\n\nGiven the complexity, let's try to write a Triton kernel for the entire forward pass? That might be too ambitious.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to write a fused kernel for the GEMM and BatchNorm? Because the BatchNorm is immediately after the GEMM.\n\nBut note: the BatchNorm in the model is an instance of nn.BatchNorm1d. It has running mean and variance? Actually, during inference, it uses the running statistics. But during training, it uses the batch statistics. The problem does not specify training or inference? The evaluation pipeline runs the model? We must assume inference? Because we are given a single input.\n\nBut note: the model is an nn.Module, and we are to rewrite it. The BatchNorm in the model is in training mode? Or in eval mode? The problem does not specify. We should assume both? But the problem says \"functionally equivalent\". So we must do the same thing.\n\nBut the BatchNorm during training and during inference are different. Without knowing, we must be safe.\n\nAlternatively, we can only focus on the pointwise operations? But they are cheap.\n\nGiven the above, I propose to start by replacing the GELU and ReLU with a Triton kernel? But they are cheap.\n\nAlternatively, we can try to fuse the pointwise operations? For example, after the BatchNorm we do GELU, then GroupNorm, then mean, then ReLU. But note: the GroupNorm and the mean are reductions and are not pointwise.\n\nWe might write a kernel that does the GroupNorm and then the mean? But the GroupNorm requires per-group statistics, and then the mean is over the entire feature? That would be two reductions? We can do it in one pass? But note: the mean over the entire feature is independent of the groups? So we can compute both the per-group statistics (for GroupNorm) and the overall mean in one reduction pass? Then we can do the normalization and then the mean? That would save a pass.\n\nBut note: the GroupNorm operation is defined as:\n    GroupNorm: \n        Input: [N, C] -> split into G groups -> [N, G, C//G]\n        Then for each group and each sample, compute mean and variance over the last dimension (C//G).\n        Then normalize: (x - mean) / sqrt(var+eps) * gamma + beta\n\n    Then the next operation is mean over the entire C dimension? That is: \n        output = mean(normalized_x, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\nBut note: the normalized_x has been normalized per group? Then the mean over the entire C dimension is the average of the normalized features? \n\nWe can compute the overall mean without writing the entire normalized tensor? Actually, no: because we have to compute the normalized tensor to compute the mean? Or can we express the overall mean in terms of the group means? \n\nLet the normalized tensor be y. The overall mean for a sample is:\n    mean(y) = (1/C) * sum_{g} [sum_{i in group g} y_i]\n\nBut note: the normalization for group g: \n    y_i = (x_i - mu_g) / sqrt(sigma_g^2 + eps) * gamma_i + beta_i\n\nBut the gamma and beta are per channel? So they are different for each i. Therefore, we cannot compute the overall mean without computing each y_i.\n\nTherefore, we cannot avoid writing the entire normalized tensor? Then we cannot fuse the GroupNorm and the mean without storing the intermediate? And then the mean operation is a separate reduction? So we are doing two reductions: one for the GroupNorm (per group) and one for the mean (over the entire feature). \n\nBut note: we can compute the overall mean in the same kernel that does the GroupNorm? That would avoid an extra kernel launch and an extra pass over the data.\n\nSo we can do:\n  Step 1: Compute per-group mean and variance (for GroupNorm) and also accumulate the overall sum? Actually, we can compute the overall sum by just accumulating the entire tensor? Then we can do:\n      overall_sum = 0\n      for each group g:\n          group_sum = 0\n          group_sq_sum = 0\n          for each i in group g:\n              group_sum += x_i\n              group_sq_sum += x_i*x_i\n          mu_g = group_sum / group_size\n          sigma_g = sqrt(group_sq_sum/group_size - mu_g*mu_g + eps)\n\n          # Now we can compute the normalized values for the group and also add to the overall sum?\n          for each i in group g:\n              y_i = (x_i - mu_g) / sigma_g * gamma_i + beta_i\n              overall_sum += y_i\n\n      overall_mean = overall_sum / C\n\n  Then we do ReLU on overall_mean? Actually, the ReLU is on the overall_mean (which is a scalar per sample). But note: the ReLU is applied after the mean? So we have one value per sample? Then we can do:\n      output = max(overall_mean, 0)\n\n  But note: the original model does:\n      x = self.group_norm(x)   -> [128,1024]\n      x = torch.mean(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)  -> [128,1]\n      x = torch.relu(x)   -> [128,1]\n\n  So if we do the above, we can output [128,1] and skip writing the [128,1024] tensor? But the model returns the [128,1] tensor.\n\n  However, the model currently returns the tensor of shape [128,1]. So we can avoid writing the intermediate normalized tensor? That would save a lot of memory bandwidth.\n\n  This would be a significant optimization.\n\nBut note: the model also has a GELU and a BatchNorm before the GroupNorm. We are not touching them? We are only replacing the GroupNorm, the mean, and the ReLU? But the GELU is before the GroupNorm.\n\nAlternatively, we can also fuse the GELU? But the GELU is a pointwise operation that comes before the GroupNorm. We can apply it when we load the data? That would be easy.\n\nSo the plan:\n\n  We will write a Triton kernel that does:\n      Input: \n          x: tensor of shape [batch_size, out_features]  (after BatchNorm and GELU)\n          gamma: the weight of the GroupNorm (of length out_features)\n          beta: the bias of the GroupNorm (of length out_features)\n          num_groups: the number of groups (8 in the example)\n          eps: for variance\n\n      Steps:\n          We split the out_features dimension into num_groups groups, each of group_size = out_features // num_groups.\n\n          For each sample and each group, we compute:\n              group_mean, group_variance\n\n          Then, we normalize the entire group and also accumulate the overall sum for the entire feature vector per sample.\n\n          Then we compute the overall mean per sample.\n\n          Then we apply ReLU: if the overall mean is negative, output 0; else, output the overall mean.\n\n          Then we output the overall mean for each sample (with shape [batch_size, 1]).\n\n      We skip writing the intermediate normalized tensor of size [batch_size, out_features].\n\n  This kernel will replace:\n        x = torch.nn.functional.gelu(x)   # Actually, the input to our kernel is after GELU? But note: the GELU is already applied? Or we can move it?\n        x = self.group_norm(x)\n        x = torch.mean(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n        x = torch.relu(x)\n\n  But note: the input to the GroupNorm is after the GELU. So we can do the GELU inside the kernel? Actually, we can do:\n\n        We are going to load the input from after the BatchNorm. Then we will apply GELU, then do the GroupNorm, then the mean, then ReLU.\n\n  So we can fuse four operations: GELU, GroupNorm, mean, ReLU.\n\n  This would save:\n      - Writing the intermediate after GELU? But the BatchNorm is already done? The BatchNorm output is written? But we can avoid that? Actually, no: the BatchNorm is a separate operation.\n\n  But note: the BatchNorm is done by a PyTorch op. We are not replacing it. So the input to our kernel is the output of the BatchNorm. Then we do:\n        x_gelu = gelu(x)\n        then the rest.\n\n  But we can do the GELU on the fly when we load the data.\n\n  Therefore, the kernel would do:\n      For each sample i and each group g, and within the group, we:\n          - Load a block of data (the group) from the input (which is after BatchNorm) and apply GELU on the fly? \n          OR\n          - We can do: \n                data = tl.load(...)\n                data_gelu = gelu(data)\n          Then use data_gelu to compute the group statistics? \n\n      But note: the GroupNorm is applied on the GELU output.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do the GELU in a separate kernel? But then we are writing a large intermediate. By fusing, we avoid that.\n\n  Therefore, we design a kernel that does:\n      input: \n          x_ptr: pointer to the input (after BatchNorm) of shape [batch_size, out_features]\n          gamma_ptr: the gamma of GroupNorm (of length out_features)\n          beta_ptr: the beta of GroupNorm (of length out_features)\n          output_ptr: the output tensor of shape [batch_size, 1]\n          num_groups: tl.constexpr\n          group_size: tl.constexpr (out_features // num_groups)\n          eps: tl.constexpr\n\n      Steps:\n          pid = tl.program_id(0)   # we use one program per sample? and then within the sample, we have groups? \n          But note: we have batch_size samples and num_groups groups per sample -> total of batch_size * num_groups work items? But we want to compute the overall mean per sample, so we need to reduce across groups? \n\n          We can do:\n              pid = tl.program_id(0)\n              sample_id = pid // num_groups   # but note: we are going to have batch_size * num_groups program ids? and then we do a reduction per sample? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use two program_id axes: \n              axis0: sample_id (0..batch_size-1)\n              axis1: group_id (0..num_groups-1)\n\n          But Triton only supports 1D grid? \n\n          So we do:\n              total_programs = batch_size * num_groups\n              pid = tl.program_id(0)\n              sample_id = pid // num_groups\n              group_id = pid % num_groups\n\n          Then we load the group: \n              base = sample_id * out_features + group_id * group_size\n              offsets = base + tl.arange(0, group_size)\n              mask = tl.arange(0, group_size) < group_size   # always true? but if out_features is not divisible? we must ensure it is.\n\n          Actually, the model has out_features=1024 and num_groups=8 -> group_size=128.\n\n          Then we load:\n              x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=...)\n              gamma = tl.load(gamma_ptr + offsets, mask=...)\n              beta = tl.load(beta_ptr + offsets, mask=...)\n\n          Then apply GELU to x? \n\n          Then compute the group mean and variance for the GELUed x? \n\n          Then normalize the group? \n\n          Then we also want to accumulate the overall sum for the sample? \n\n          But note: the overall sum is over the entire feature, which is over all groups. We are processing one group per program. We need to communicate between groups? \n\n          So we have to do a two-pass reduction? \n\n          Alternatively, we can use atomics? But atomics are expensive and we are accumulating per sample? \n\n          We can do:\n              - First, we compute the per-group mean and variance and also the per-group sum of the normalized values? \n                But then the overall mean is the sum of the per-group normalized sums? \n\n          Actually, we cannot compute the per-group normalized values without knowing the group statistics? So we have to do two passes? \n\n          How about:\n              Pass 1: Compute per-group statistics (mean and variance) for the GELUed data? \n              Pass 2: Now that we know the group statistics, we can compute the normalized values and then the overall sum? \n\n          But note: we cannot do two passes in one kernel? We would have to store the intermediate group statistics? \n\n          We can allocate a temporary buffer for the group statistics? \n\n          Given the complexity, and the fact that the problem says \"small iterative steps\", we might reconsider.\n\n  Alternatively, we can do the entire GroupNorm in one kernel without fusing the mean and ReLU? Then we write the normalized tensor? Then we do a separate kernel for the mean and ReLU? That would be two kernels? But we are replacing three operations with two kernels? And we are avoiding the GELU intermediate? \n\n  But note: the GroupNorm kernel would write the normalized tensor, then the mean kernel would read it? That would be a global memory read? \n\n  We could fuse the mean and ReLU in a very simple kernel? \n\n  However, the mean is a reduction over 1024 elements? That is small. We can do that with a simple Triton kernel? \n\n  Therefore, let's break the fusion:\n\n      Kernel 1: GroupNorm (including GELU) -> input: [batch_size, out_features] (after BatchNorm), output: [batch_size, out_features] (normalized)\n      Kernel 2: Mean and ReLU -> input: [batch_size, out_features], output: [batch_size, 1]\n\n  But note: the current model does GELU before GroupNorm. We are moving the GELU into the GroupNorm kernel? \n\n  We can write:\n\n      Kernel for GroupNorm (with fused GELU):\n          We do the GroupNorm but we apply GELU on the input on the fly.\n\n      Then we call that kernel, then call a kernel for the mean and ReLU.\n\n  But then we are still writing the intermediate normalized tensor? \n\n  Alternatively, we can do the entire chain from BatchNorm output to the final [128,1] output in one kernel? \n\n  Given the complexity of two reductions (one per group and one per sample) and the need for communication between groups, it might be better to do a kernel per sample? \n\n  We can do:\n\n      For each sample i in batch:\n          We load the entire row (out_features=1024) into the kernel? \n          Then we do:\n              - Apply GELU to the entire row? \n              - Split the row into groups (8 groups of 128)\n              - For each group, compute the mean and variance? \n              - Then normalize each group? \n              - Then compute the mean of the entire row? \n              - Then ReLU.\n\n          Then we output one value.\n\n      This kernel would be launched with batch_size programs.\n\n      Steps in the kernel for one sample:\n          Let row = the entire feature vector of the sample (1024 elements).\n          We split into 8 groups. We have to compute 8 means and 8 variances? \n          How to compute the group means? We can do:\n\n              group_means = [0] * num_groups\n              group_vars = [0] * num_groups   # but we don't need the full variance? we need the sum of squares as well.\n\n          But we are limited by the number of registers? And we cannot have arrays of unknown size in Triton? \n\n          Alternatively, we can do nested reductions? \n\n          We can loop over groups? But the number of groups is small (8). We can have 8 registers for group sums and 8 for group squares.\n\n          Then we do:\n              for group_id in range(num_groups):\n                  start = group_id * group_size\n                  end = start + group_size\n                  group_sum = 0\n                  group_sq_sum = 0\n                  for j in range(group_size):\n                      idx = start + j\n                      val = row[idx]\n                      val_gelu = gelu(val)\n                      group_sum += val_gelu\n                      group_sq_sum += val_gelu * val_gelu\n\n                  group_mean = group_sum / group_size\n                  group_std = tl.sqrt(group_sq_sum / group_size - group_mean * group_mean + eps)\n\n                  # Now we can normalize the group? But we don't want to store the normalized group? We want to accumulate the overall sum? \n                  group_sum_normalized = 0\n                  for j in range(group_size):\n                      idx = start + j\n                      val = row[idx]\n                      val_gelu = gelu(val)\n                      normalized_val = (val_gelu - group_mean) / group_std * gamma[idx] + beta[idx]\n                      group_sum_normalized += normalized_val\n\n                  overall_sum += group_sum_normalized\n\n          overall_mean = overall_sum / out_features\n          result = tl.where(overall_mean > 0, overall_mean, 0)\n\n          Then store result.\n\n      But note: this requires that we load the entire row? 1024 elements. That might be too large for the shared memory? Or we can use registers? But 1024 registers per thread? That is not feasible.\n\n      Alternatively, we can load the row in chunks? But the groups are contiguous? We can process one group at a time? But then we would have to load the entire row anyway? \n\n      Or we can have the kernel load the row in blocks? But then we would need to synchronize between blocks? And we are limited to one program per sample? \n\n      This seems complex.\n\n  Given the time constraints, and the fact that the problem asks for small iterative steps, I propose a simpler optimization: replace the GELU with a Triton kernel that does GELU in place? But that might not save much.\n\n  But note: the current model is slower than the reference? The reference timing is 0.119 ms and the custom timing is 0.143 ms. The speed_up is 0.832 (which is a slowdown). So we are to fix that.\n\n  However, the reference timing is the timing of the reference code? But the reference code is the same as the custom code? This is confusing.\n\n  Looking at the meta: \n      'reference_timing_ms': 0.119, 'custom_timing': 0.143, 'speed_up': 0.832\n\n  This means that the reference code (which is the current code) runs in 0.119 ms, and the custom code (which is also the same code) runs in 0.143 ms? That doesn't make sense.\n\n  I think there is a misunderstanding: the current program is the reference code. We are to replace it with custom Triton code. The reference_timing_ms is the timing of the reference code. The custom_timing is the timing of our custom code. In the first attempt, the custom code is the reference code, so they are the same and the speed_up should be 1. But here the reference_timing is 0.119 and custom_timing is 0.143, which is a slowdown.\n\n  This suggests that the reference_timing is measured in a different way? Or that the reference code is not the current code? \n\n  Given the complexity, and since the problem says \"small iterative steps\", I will start by replacing the mean operation with a Triton kernel? The mean operation is a reduction. We can write a efficient reduction in Triton.\n\n  The current mean operation: \n        x = torch.mean(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n\n  This reduces a [128,1024] tensor to [128,1].\n\n  We can write a Triton kernel for this reduction. And then fuse the ReLU? \n\n  Kernel for mean+ReLU:\n        input: x_ptr of [batch_size, out_features]\n        output: out_ptr of [batch_size, 1]\n\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)   # pid from 0 to batch_size-1\n\n        offsets = pid * out_features + tl.arange(0, out_features)\n        x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=tl.arange(0, out_features) < out_features, other=0)\n\n        mean = tl.sum(x, axis=0) / out_features\n        mean = tl.where(mean > 0, mean, 0)\n\n        tl.store(out_ptr + pid, mean)\n\n  This kernel is very simple.\n\n  Then in the model, after the GroupNorm, we would call this kernel instead of doing torch.mean and then ReLU.\n\n  This would save two kernel launches? Actually, the mean and ReLU are two operations in PyTorch? But they might be fused by PyTorch? Probably not.\n\n  But note: the ReLU is on the scalar mean, so it's very cheap.\n\n  However, the mean reduction in PyTorch is probably efficient. But we might save if we fuse the ReLu and avoid a kernel launch? \n\n  Given the small size, the reduction in Triton might be faster because it is done in one kernel and we avoid framework overhead.\n\n  Let's try this.\n\n  We will keep the rest of the model in PyTorch, but replace the last two operations with one Triton kernel.\n\n  Steps:\n\n      class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n          ... same __init__\n\n          def forward(self, x):\n              x = self.gemm(x)\n              x = self.batch_norm(x)\n              x = torch.nn.functional.gelu(x)\n              x = self.group_norm(x)\n\n              # Instead of:\n              #   x = torch.mean(x, dim=1, keepdim=True)\n              #   x = torch.relu(x)\n              # We do:\n              x = mean_relu(x)\n\n              return x\n\n      We will define the Triton kernel for mean_relu.\n\n  But note: the ReLU in the original is applied after the mean. And the mean is over dim=1, keepdim=True -> so x becomes [128,1]. Then ReLU is elementwise on [128,1].\n\n  Our kernel will output [128,1].\n\n  Let's write the kernel.\n\n  Note: we must be cautious of the data types. The input to the kernel is the output of GroupNorm, which is float32. The output is float32.\n\n  Kernel:\n      @triton.jit\n      def mean_relu_kernel(\n          x_ptr,\n          output_ptr,\n          out_features,\n          BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n      ):\n          pid = tl.program_id(0)   # 0..batch_size-1\n\n          # We'll use BLOCK_SIZE as the reduction block size. We set it to the next power of two >= out_features? But out_features=1024, which is a power of two.\n          offsets = pid * out_features + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n          mask = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE) < out_features\n\n          x = tl.load(x_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n          # Sum the entire row.\n          row_sum = tl.sum(x, axis=0)\n          mean = row_sum / out_features\n\n          # ReLU: max(0, mean)\n          result = tl.where(mean > 0, mean, 0.0)\n\n          tl.store(output_ptr + pid, result)\n\n      Then the wrapper:\n          def mean_relu(x):\n              assert x.dim() == 2, \"Input must be 2D\"\n              batch_size, out_features = x.shape\n              output = torch.empty(batch_size, 1, device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)\n\n              # The kernel is launched with batch_size blocks.\n              grid = (batch_size,)\n              BLOCK_SIZE = triton.next_power_of_2(out_features)\n              mean_relu_kernel[grid](x, output, out_features, BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n              return output\n\n  But note: the reduction might be done in one step? But if out_features is large, we might need to do a tree reduction? The current reduction uses a single block per sample? And the block size is 1024? That is within the limits (up to 1024 per block). So it should be fine.\n\n  However, the Triton sum might do a tree reduction internally.\n\n  This kernel is very simple and should be correct.\n\n  Let's hope that it speeds up the last two operations.\n\n  We are only changing the last two operations. The rest remain in PyTorch.\n\n  This is a small change.\n\n  We must ensure that the output is the same.\n\n  We will return the new model with this change.\n\n  Note: we must also handle the case where out_features is not a power of two? But in our case it is 1024.\n\n  But to be general, we use:\n      BLOCK_SIZE = triton.next_power_of_2(out_features)\n\n  But note: the mask ensures we don't read out of bounds.\n\n  Let's write the code accordingly.\n\n  We will replace the current model's forward pass after the group_norm with a call to this new function.\n\n  We must also define the Triton kernel and the helper function.\n\n  We will include the kernel inside the module? Or outside? We can define it outside the module.\n\n  But note: the EVOLVE-BLOCK must contain the entire code? Yes.\n\n  So we will write the kernel inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n  Let's do it.\n\n  IMPORTANT: We must not change the class name (ModelNew) or the function get_inputs and get_init_inputs.\n\n  We will keep the batch_size, in_features, etc.\n\n  We will also keep the same __init__.\n\n  Only change the forward method for the last two operations.\n\n  Let's write the code.\n</think>\nTo improve performance, we'll replace the PyTorch mean and ReLU operations with an optimized Triton kernel that fuses both operations. This reduces kernel launch overhead and leverages efficient parallel reduction for the mean calculation. The key optimizations include:\n1. Fusing the mean reduction and ReLU into a single kernel\n2. Using efficient Triton reduction operations\n3. Optimized memory access patterns with vectorization\n\nHere's the complete implementation:\n\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef fused_mean_relu_kernel(\n    x_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    n_cols,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    row_idx = tl.program_id(0)\n    x_offset = row_idx * n_cols\n    col_offsets = tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = col_offsets < n_cols\n    \n    # Load input with boundary checks\n    x = tl.load(x_ptr + x_offset + col_offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n    \n    # Compute mean using efficient reduction\n    row_sum = tl.sum(x, axis=0)\n    mean_val = row_sum / n_cols\n    \n    # Apply ReLU and store result\n    result = tl.where(mean_val > 0, mean_val, 0.0)\n    tl.store(output_ptr + row_idx, result)\n\ndef fused_mean_relu(x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:\n    n_rows, n_cols = x.shape\n    output = torch.empty(n_rows, 1, device=x.device, dtype=x.dtype)\n    \n    # Configure kernel grid and block size\n    grid = (n_rows,)\n    block_size = triton.next_power_of_2(n_cols)\n    fused_mean_relu_kernel[grid](x, output, n_cols, BLOCK_SIZE=block_size)\n    \n    return output\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, in_features, out_features, num_groups):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n        self.gemm = nn.Linear(in_features, out_features)\n        self.batch_norm = nn.BatchNorm1d(out_features)\n        self.group_norm = nn.GroupNorm(num_groups, out_features)\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        x = self.gemm(x)\n        x = self.batch_norm(x)\n        x = torch.nn.functional.gelu(x)\n        x = self.group_norm(x)\n        x = fused_mean_relu(x)  # Replaces mean + ReLU with fused kernel\n        return x\n\nbatch_size = 128\nin_features = 512\nout_features = 1024\nnum_groups = 8\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    return [torch.randn(batch_size, in_features)]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return [in_features, out_features, num_groups]\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

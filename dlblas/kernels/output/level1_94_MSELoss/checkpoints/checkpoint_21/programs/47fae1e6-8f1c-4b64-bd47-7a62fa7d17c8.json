targets) ** 2)`\n\n However, note that the current program is using a reference PyTorch implementation and we are to rewrite it in Triton for performance.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We are going to write a Triton kernel to compute the MSE loss efficiently.\n 2. The Triton kernel will compute the squared difference for each element and then reduce to the mean.\n 3. We note that the input tensors are of shape (batch_size, 4096). We can process each element in parallel.\n\n Approach:\n  - We will launch one program per row (i.e., per batch element) and then do a reduction across the row and then across the batch?\n  - However, note that the loss is a scalar for the entire batch? Actually, the original returns a scalar.\n\n  But wait: the original `torch.mean((predictions - targets) ** 2)` returns a single scalar for the entire tensor.\n\n  How to do it in Triton?\n  We can do:\n    total = 0.0\n    for each element in the entire tensor:\n        diff = predictions[i] - targets[i]\n        total += diff * diff\n    total = total / (batch_size * 4096)\n\n  However, we cannot loop over the entire tensor in one kernel because the tensor is too big? We can use multiple blocks and then do a reduction.\n\n  Alternatively, we can break the computation into two steps:\n    Step 1: Compute the squared difference per element and then do a reduction per block, then\n    Step 2: Combine the per-block sums and then divide by the total number of elements.\n\n  But note: the problem size is (batch_size, 4096) = 128 * 4096 = 524288 elements. We can use one kernel that does a reduction over the entire tensor.\n\n  We can design a reduction kernel that uses multiple blocks and then does a tree reduction.\n\n  However, let's note that the original operation is very simple and might be memory bound. But we are going to try to accelerate it by parallelizing.\n\n  We will do:\n    - Each block will process a contiguous chunk of the flattened tensor.\n    - We will use a grid that covers the entire flattened tensor (with block size being a power of two, say 1024).\n    - Then we will have grid_size = ceil(524288 / 1024) = 512 blocks.\n\n  Steps in the kernel:\n    - Each block computes the sum of squared differences for its chunk.\n    - Then we do a reduction across the blocks to get the total sum.\n\n  We can use two kernels? Or we can use one kernel with two phases? Triton supports atomic operations, but we can also use a two-step reduction.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the `tl.atomic_add` to accumulate the sum in a global memory location. However, atomic operations might be slow.\n\n  Instead, we can do:\n    - First, we allocate a temporary buffer for the per-block sums (of size grid_size).\n    - Then we launch a kernel that writes the per-block sum to this buffer.\n    - Then we launch a second kernel to reduce the temporary buffer to a single scalar.\n\n  But note: the problem requires a single scalar output. We want to minimize kernel launches.\n\n  We can do it in one kernel? Actually, we can do a single kernel that does the entire reduction if we use a grid of 1 block? That would not be efficient.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use the Triton reduction operators that are efficient. However, we are going to design a two-stage reduction.\n\n  However, for simplicity and because the tensor is not extremely huge, we can use a single kernel that does the entire reduction? But 524288 elements is within the maximum number of threads per block? No, because the maximum threads per block is 1024. So we need multiple blocks.\n\n  We can use the following:\n\n    total_sum = 0.0\n    for i in range(0, num_elements, BLOCK_SIZE):\n        ... load a block of data\n        ... compute the squared differences and sum them in the block\n        ... then use atomic_add to add the block sum to total_sum\n\n    Then after the kernel, we do: total_sum / num_elements\n\n  But atomic_add might be a bottleneck? However, the number of atomic operations is only 512, which is acceptable.\n\n  Steps for the kernel:\n\n    pid = tl.program_id(0)\n    offsets = pid * BLOCK_SIZE + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = offsets < num_elements\n\n    x = tl.load(predictions_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    y = tl.load(targets_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n\n    diff = x - y\n    sq = diff * diff\n    block_sum = tl.sum(sq, axis=0)   # This does a reduction in the block\n\n    # Then we atomically add block_sum to the output (which is a single element)\n    tl.atomic_add(output_ptr, block_sum)\n\n  But note: the output is a scalar. We have to initialize it to zero.\n\n  Then after the kernel, we divide by the total number of elements.\n\n  However, the kernel must be launched with grid = [grid_size] and output_ptr pointing to a tensor of one element.\n\n  The forward function would be:\n\n    output = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=predictions.dtype)\n    num_elements = predictions.numel()\n    grid_size = (num_elements + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE\n    _mse_kernel[grid_size](predictions, targets, output, num_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n    loss = output / num_elements\n\n  But note: the original returns a scalar tensor. We can return output / num_elements.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the Triton kernel uses atomic_add, which might have precision issues? But since it's floating point, and the order of addition is non-deterministic, it should be acceptable.\n\n  Alternatively, we can use a two-pass reduction without atomics? That would require two kernels. We are going to try the atomic approach first.\n\n  Let's write the kernel.\n\n  Important: We are using the same function signature for the model. The inputs are two tensors: predictions and targets.\n\n  We are going to write:\n\n    class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        def __init__(self):\n            super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n\n        def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n            # Flatten the tensors\n            predictions = predictions.view(-1)\n            targets = targets.view(-1)\n            num_elements = predictions.numel()\n\n            # Allocate output for the sum of squares\n            output = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=predictions.dtype)\n\n            # Grid and kernel\n            BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n            grid_size = (num_elements + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE\n            _mse_kernel[grid_size](predictions, targets, output, num_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n            return output / num_elements\n\n  We must define the kernel.\n\n  However, note: the current program also defines batch_size, input_shape, and dim, and two functions: get_inputs and get_init_inputs.\n\n  We must keep the same structure. We are only allowed to change the ModelNew class and the kernel.\n\n  We will write the kernel above the class.\n\n  Let's write the kernel:\n\n    import triton\n    import triton.language as tl\n\n    @triton.jit\n    def _mse_kernel(predictions_ptr, targets_ptr, output_ptr, num_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n        offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < num_elements\n\n        x = tl.load(predictions_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n        y = tl.load(targets_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n\n        diff = x - y\n        sq = diff * diff\n        block_sum = tl.sum(sq, axis=0)\n\n        # Atomically add to the output\n        tl.atomic_add(output_ptr, block_sum)\n\n  But note: the output_ptr points to a tensor of one element. We are adding to the first element.\n\n  However, we must be cautious: the atomic_add might not be supported for all dtypes? We assume float32.\n\n  Also, note that the input tensors might be of any dtype? The original uses whatever is passed. We are using the same dtype for the output.\n\n  But the original operation: `(predictions - targets) ** 2` might be in float? Let's assume the inputs are float32.\n\n  We can add an assertion to check the dtype? Or we can convert to float32 if needed? But the original works for any dtype? Actually, the original might work for integer too? But the Triton kernel must be for float32? We can handle both by converting to float32 in the kernel? Or we can design for float32 only.\n\n  Since the problem does not specify, we assume the inputs are float32.\n\n  Alternatively, we can make the kernel generic? But the problem states that the Triton code should be equivalent.\n\n  Let's stick to float32 for now. We can convert the inputs if they are not.\n\n  However, the original model does not convert. We must be cautious.\n\n  But note: the original uses `torch.mean` which returns a float tensor? Actually, the operation (predictions - targets) ** 2 will promote to float if the inputs are integer? We are not sure.\n\n  To be safe, we can do:\n\n    predictions = predictions.view(-1).to(torch.float32)\n    targets = targets.view(-1).to(torch.float32)\n\n  But this adds overhead? Alternatively, we can write the kernel to handle multiple dtypes? Triton supports multiple dtypes.\n\n  However, for simplicity and because the problem size is fixed, we assume float32.\n\n  But the problem says: the original program uses two tensors of shape (batch_size, 4096). The get_inputs function uses torch.randn, which produces float32.\n\n  So we are safe.\n\n  Let's write the code.\n\n  However, note: the reduction operation `tl.sum` might be efficient? And we are using atomic_add. This should be efficient because the number of atomic operations is the grid size (512) which is small.\n\n  We can also try to use a more efficient reduction by having multiple warps? But the block reduction is already handled by `tl.sum`.\n\n  We can also tune the block size? We set 1024 arbitrarily.\n\n  We will use the autotune for the block size? But the problem says to do small steps. We can leave it fixed for now.\n\n  We will write the kernel and the model.\n\n  Also note: we must not change the get_inputs and get_init_inputs functions. We leave them as they are.\n\n  We are going to output:\n\n    import math\n    import torch\n    import torch.nn as nn\n    import triton\n    import triton.language as tl\n\n    # Define the Triton kernel\n    @triton.jit\n    def _mse_kernel(predictions_ptr, targets_ptr, output_ptr, num_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n        ... as above ...\n\n    class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n        ... as above ...\n\n    batch_size = 128\n    input_shape = (4096, )\n    dim = 1\n\n    def get_inputs():\n        return [torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape), torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape)]\n\n    def get_init_inputs():\n        return []\n\n  But note: the original program did not have Triton imports. We must add them.\n\n  However, the problem says: \"Modify ONLY the Triton kernel source within this block - all other code is LOCKED.\" But in this case, we are adding a kernel and changing the ModelNew.forward.\n\n  We are allowed to change the EVOLVE-BLOCK. We are going to write the entire block.\n\n  We note that the original block had:\n      import torch\n      import torch.nn as nn\n\n  We are going to add:\n      import triton\n      import triton.language as tl\n\n  And then the kernel and then the model.\n\n  Let's write the code.\n\n  Important: We must initialize the output tensor to zero.\n\n  We'll do:\n\n        output = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n  Then we launch the kernel.\n\n  Then return output[0] / num_elements? But note the original returns a scalar tensor. We can return output / num_elements, which is a tensor of one element? But the original returns a scalar tensor (0-dim). We can do:\n\n        return (output / num_elements).squeeze()\n\n  Or we can do:\n\n        return output[0] / num_elements\n\n  But note: the output of the original is a scalar tensor. We can do:\n\n        return output / num_elements   # which is a tensor of shape [1]\n\n  But the original returns a scalar tensor (shape []). We can use:\n\n        return output / num_elements   # then call .view([]) ? Or just use .item()? No, we must return a tensor.\n\n        return (output / num_elements)[0]   # this would be a scalar? Actually, it's a tensor with one element.\n\n        return (output / num_elements).squeeze()   # this would remove the dimension.\n\n  We can do:\n\n        loss = output / num_elements\n        return loss[0]   # This returns a scalar tensor? Actually, no: loss[0] is a scalar tensor? But it has 0 dim? Actually, no: loss[0] is a scalar value? We want a tensor.\n\n        return loss.squeeze(0)\n\n  Alternatively, we can do:\n\n        return loss.view([])\n\n  But the simplest is to use:\n\n        return loss[0]   # This returns a tensor of 0-dim? Actually, no: it returns a scalar tensor? Let's test in PyTorch:\n\n          x = torch.tensor([3.5])\n          y = x[0]   # y is a scalar tensor? Actually, yes: it is a 0-dim tensor.\n\n        So we can do:\n\n            return output[0] / num_elements\n\n        This returns a 0-dim tensor.\n\n  We'll do that.\n\n  Code for the forward:\n\n        def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n            # Flatten the tensors\n            predictions = predictions.contiguous().view(-1)\n            targets = targets.contiguous().view(-1)\n            num_elements = predictions.numel()\n            if num_elements == 0:\n                return torch.tensor(0.0, device=predictions.device)\n\n            # Allocate output for the sum of squares\n            output = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n            # Grid and kernel\n            BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n            grid_size = (num_elements + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE\n            _mse_kernel[grid_size](predictions, targets, output, num_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n            return output[0] / num_elements\n\n  We added contiguous() to ensure the tensors are contiguous.\n\n  Also, we handle the case of zero elements.\n\n  Let's write the entire block.\n\n  Note: We are only changing the EVOLVE-BLOCK. We are replacing the entire ModelNew and adding the kernel.\n\n  But note: the original block had batch_size, input_shape, dim, get_inputs, get_init_inputs. We leave those.\n\n  We output:\n\n      # ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\n      ... our code ...\n      # =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n\n  We are going to write:\n\n      import triton\n      import triton.language as tl\n\n      @triton.jit\n      def _mse_kernel(...):\n          ...\n\n      class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n          ...\n\n      ... the rest (batch_size, input_shape, etc.)\n\n  Let's write it.\n\n  Note: We are using the same class name: ModelNew.\n\n  We hope this will be faster.\n\n  However, note: the original operation is very simple and might be memory bound. Our kernel is also memory bound? But we are doing the same operations: two loads, one subtraction, one multiplication, and then a reduction. The reduction in the block is done in registers? So it might be faster because we are reducing the number of writes? And we are using atomic_add only 512 times? We hope so.\n\n  We'll see.\n\n  If it doesn't improve, we might have to use a different approach.\n\n  But let's try.\n\n  IMPORTANT: We must not change the signature of the ModelNew.forward method.\n\n  We are ready.\n\n  Note: The kernel must be compiled and run correctly.\n\n  We are using the same inputs: two tensors of shape (batch_size, 4096). We flatten them to (batch_size * 4096,).\n\n  We are using a grid of (grid_size,) and block size of 1024.\n\n  We are using the atomic_add for the output.\n\n  Let's code.\n</think>\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef _mse_kernel(\n    predictions_ptr,\n    targets_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    num_elements,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(0)\n    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = offsets < num_elements\n    \n    x = tl.load(predictions_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    y = tl.load(targets_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    \n    diff = x - y\n    sq = diff * diff\n    block_sum = tl.sum(sq, axis=0)\n    \n    tl.atomic_add(output_ptr, block_sum)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n\n    def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n        predictions = predictions.contiguous().view(-1)\n        targets = targets.contiguous().view(-1)\n        num_elements = predictions.numel()\n        \n        if num_elements == 0:\n            return torch.tensor(0.0, device=predictions.device)\n        \n        output = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=torch.float32)\n        BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n        grid_size = (num_elements + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE\n        \n        _mse_kernel[grid_size](\n            predictions, \n            targets, \n            output, \n            num_elements,\n            BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE\n        )\n        \n        return output[0] / num_elements\n\nbatch_size = 128\ninput_shape = (4096, )\ndim = 1\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    return [torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape), torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape)]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}

targets) ** 2)\n\n However, note that the problem states we are to generate Triton implementations for performance.\n The current code is pure PyTorch and we are to replace it with a Triton kernel for the MSE computation.\n\n Steps:\n 1. We note that the input tensors are of shape (batch_size, 4096). We can process each row independently.\n 2. We will write a Triton kernel that computes the squared error for each element in a row, then sums them, and then averages over the row (i.e., divide by the row length).\n 3. However, note that the overall loss is the mean over the entire tensor. Alternatively, we can compute the squared error per row and then average the row losses? \n    But the original formula: \n        loss = mean( (predictions - targets)^2 ) \n    This is the same as: \n        loss = (1/(batch_size * 4096)) * sum( (predictions - targets)^2 )\n\n 4. We can design a two-stage reduction:\n    Stage 1: Each block computes the sum of squared errors for a row (or a contiguous part of a row if the row is too long).\n    Stage 2: Then we combine the partial sums from all blocks and divide by the total number of elements.\n\n However, note that the problem constraints:\n   - We cannot change the function signature of the forward method (it takes predictions and targets and returns a scalar tensor).\n   - We cannot change the grid configuration arbitrarily? Actually, we are allowed to design the grid.\n\n But note the constraints in the problem:\n   \u274c NEVER change @triton.jit function signatures or parameter names? Actually, we are writing a new kernel so we design the signature.\n   However, the EVOLVE-BLOCK contains the entire class and helper functions. We are to replace the forward method with a Triton-based one.\n\n Important: We must maintain the same inputs and outputs.\n\n Approach:\n   We will write a Triton kernel that computes the sum of squared errors for the entire tensor in one go? But the tensor is of size (128, 4096) = 524288 elements.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use two kernels: one for per-row reduction and then one for the final mean? Or we can do it in one kernel.\n\n   However, note that Triton does not support global synchronization across the entire grid. So we can do:\n\n   Option 1: \n      Kernel 1: Each block processes one row (or multiple rows) and outputs a partial sum for that row (or a set of rows). Then we do a second kernel to sum all the partial sums and divide by the total number of elements.\n\n   Option 2: \n      One kernel that uses atomic operations to accumulate the global sum. But note: we are using FP32 and atomic add for FP32 is supported in Triton? Actually, Triton does support atomic_add for float32.\n\n   However, we note that the problem says: \"Replace staged softmax with online/FlashAttention variants\" -> so we are allowed to use multiple stages? But we are also constrained by the fact that we must not change the grid configuration arbitrarily? Actually, we are allowed to design the grid for our kernel.\n\n   Since the problem says: \"NEVER change grid configuration\" only applies to the existing Triton code? In our case, we are starting from PyTorch.\n\n   We are allowed to change the internal implementation.\n\n   We choose Option 2: one kernel that uses atomic_add to accumulate the global sum.\n\n   Steps in the kernel:\n      - Each program ID (which we can think of as a 1D grid) will process a contiguous block of elements.\n      - We will compute the squared difference for each element in the block and sum them.\n      - Then we will atomically add this block sum to a global accumulator (a single float32 value).\n\n   Then, after the kernel, we will divide the accumulator by the total number of elements (batch_size * 4096) to get the mean.\n\n   However, note: atomic operations might lead to contention? But the number of blocks is (total_elements + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE. For 524288 elements and BLOCK_SIZE=1024, we have 512 blocks. This is acceptable.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use a reduction tree in shared memory within a block and then one atomic add per block? That is more efficient.\n\n   We design:\n      - Let BLOCK_SIZE be the number of elements per block (must be a power of two for reduction).\n      - Each block loads BLOCK_SIZE elements from both predictions and targets (with masking for the last block).\n      - Compute the squared difference for each element and then reduce within the block to a single sum.\n      - Then one atomic add per block to the global accumulator.\n\n   We then launch the kernel and then divide the accumulator by the total number of elements.\n\n   Steps in code:\n\n      1. Allocate a tensor for the accumulator (a single float32 value on the device).\n      2. Set the accumulator to zero.\n      3. Define the grid: (n_blocks,) where n_blocks = (total_elements + BLOCK_SIZE - 1) // BLOCK_SIZE.\n      4. Launch the kernel.\n      5. Divide the accumulator by the total number of elements.\n\n   But note: the kernel must be designed to avoid race conditions? We are using one atomic_add per block so that is safe.\n\n   However, we must note that the kernel should be efficient.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use Triton's built-in reduction operations? Actually, we are going to write the reduction manually.\n\n   We'll use a block-level reduction using a loop.\n\n   Implementation of the kernel:\n\n      @triton.jit\n      def mse_kernel(pred_ptr, target_ptr, output_ptr, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n          pid = tl.program_id(0)\n          offsets = pid * BLOCK_SIZE + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n          mask = offsets < total_elements\n\n          pred = tl.load(pred_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n          target = tl.load(target_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n          diff = pred - target\n          squared_diff = diff * diff\n\n          # Now reduce squared_diff in the block to a single value\n          block_sum = tl.sum(squared_diff, axis=0)\n\n          # Now we need to atomically add block_sum to the output_ptr (which is a single element)\n          tl.atomic_add(output_ptr, block_sum)\n\n   Then in the forward function:\n\n      total_elements = predictions.numel()\n      # Allocate a tensor for the accumulator (scalar)\n      accumulator = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n      # Grid and block\n      BLOCK_SIZE = 1024   # This can be tuned, but 1024 is a good starting point\n      grid = lambda meta: ((total_elements + meta['BLOCK_SIZE'] - 1) // meta['BLOCK_SIZE'],)\n      mse_kernel[grid](predictions, targets, accumulator, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n      # Now divide by total_elements\n      loss = accumulator / total_elements\n\n   However, note: the Triton kernel does not support passing a scalar by reference? Actually, we can pass a pointer to a tensor of size 1.\n\n   But note: the atomic_add operation in Triton requires the pointer to be of the same type (float32) and the value to add is float32.\n\n   Also note: we must consider that the kernel might be launched asynchronously? We need to synchronize after the kernel?\n\n   We can use: torch.cuda.synchronize()? But that might hurt performance. Alternatively, we can rely on the fact that when we access the accumulator it will be synchronized? Actually, we are in the same stream.\n\n   However, to be safe, we can synchronize.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"NEVER introduce race conditions, uninitialized reads, or sync gaps\". We are using atomic_add so it's safe.\n\n   However, we must note that the entire kernel must complete before we read the accumulator.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        loss = accumulator / total_elements\n        # This operation will wait for the kernel to complete because the division is on the GPU and we are in the same stream.\n\n   But to be safe, we can use:\n\n        torch.cuda.synchronize()   # This might be heavy, but for the correctness we do it.\n\n   Alternatively, we can avoid synchronization by using a single element tensor and then do the division without sync? The kernel is launched and then we do the division. The division will be scheduled after the kernel in the same stream? Then it's safe.\n\n   So we don't need explicit sync.\n\n   But note: the kernel might not have finished when we do the division? Actually, PyTorch launches kernels asynchronously, but the subsequent operation (like the division) is queued in the same stream and will wait for the kernel to finish.\n\n   So it's safe.\n\n   However, we must note that the kernel is launched in the default stream, and the division is also in the default stream -> so it's safe.\n\n   Now, we must also note that the inputs might be non-contiguous? The problem says we can precompute strides. We are using a 1D view of the tensor? We can flatten the tensors.\n\n   We can do:\n\n        predictions = predictions.contiguous().view(-1)\n        targets = targets.contiguous().view(-1)\n\n   Then the kernel can use 1D access.\n\n   But note: the original input shape is (batch_size, 4096). We are flattening to (batch_size * 4096). That is acceptable.\n\n   So the plan:\n\n        def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n            # Flatten the tensors\n            predictions = predictions.contiguous().view(-1)\n            targets = targets.contiguous().view(-1)\n            total_elements = predictions.numel()\n\n            # If there are no elements, return 0\n            if total_elements == 0:\n                return torch.tensor(0.0, device=predictions.device)\n\n            accumulator = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n            # We choose a block size that is a power of two and not too large (max 1024 or 2048, but note H100 has 1024 threads per block max? Actually, Triton allows up to 1024 per block by default? But we can set BLOCK_SIZE to 1024)\n            BLOCK_SIZE = 1024\n            grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(total_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']), )\n\n            # Launch kernel\n            mse_kernel[grid](predictions, targets, accumulator, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=BLOCK_SIZE)\n\n            return accumulator / total_elements\n\n   We must write the kernel with the appropriate signature.\n\n   However, note the problem constraints: \"NEVER change @triton.jit function signatures or parameter names\" -> for the kernel we are writing, we can design it. But note that the problem says this for existing Triton kernels? We are introducing a new one.\n\n   We are allowed.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Modify ONLY the Triton kernel source within this block - all other code is LOCKED.\"? Actually, we are replacing the entire forward method and adding a kernel.\n\n   However, the EVOLVE-BLOCK contains the entire class and helper functions. We are allowed to change the entire block.\n\n   So we will write the kernel inside the class? Actually, we can write it as a nested function? But Triton kernels must be top-level? Actually, they can be defined at any scope? But in practice, we define them at the top level.\n\n   Alternatively, we can define the kernel at the top level of the module.\n\n   But note: the EVOLVE-BLOCK must contain the entire code that is being evolved.\n\n   We can define the kernel inside the class? Actually, no, because the kernel is a function. We can define it outside the class but inside the EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n   We will write:\n\n        import triton\n        import triton.language as tl\n\n        @triton.jit\n        def mse_kernel(pred_ptr, target_ptr, output_ptr, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n            ...\n\n   And then the class.\n\n   But note: the problem says \"Return ONLY the complete updated code containing the EVOLVE-BLOCK comment marker\". So we write the entire block.\n\n   However, we must note that the original code had:\n        batch_size = 128\n        input_shape = (4096, )\n        dim = 1\n\n        def get_inputs(): ... \n        def get_init_inputs(): ...\n\n   We must keep these because they are used for testing.\n\n   We are only replacing the forward method and adding the kernel.\n\n   Also note: we must import triton and triton.language.\n\n   But the original code did not have it. We must add the import.\n\n   However, the problem says: \"NO explanations, NO markdown, NO additional text.\" -> so we just output the code.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   Important: We must check for boundary conditions.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        pid = tl.program_id(0)\n        start_idx = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n        offsets = start_idx + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n        mask = offsets < total_elements\n\n   Then load with mask.\n\n   Reduction: we can use tl.sum? Actually, tl.sum is available and it's efficient.\n\n   Alternatively, we can do a manual reduction? tl.sum is already optimized.\n\n   So we use tl.sum.\n\n   But note: tl.sum might use the fast hardware reduction. So it's efficient.\n\n   We'll use:\n\n        block_sum = tl.sum(squared_diff, axis=0)\n\n   Then atomic_add to the output_ptr.\n\n   However, note: output_ptr is a pointer to a single float. We do:\n\n        tl.atomic_add(output_ptr, block_sum)\n\n   This is safe.\n\n   Now, we must test for the case when there are no elements? We already check in the forward function.\n\n   We'll write the entire code block.\n\n   But note: the problem says we are to rewrite the program. We are replacing the forward method and adding a kernel.\n\n   We must be cautious about performance: we are using atomic_add. The number of atomic_add operations is the number of blocks. For 524288 elements and block size 1024, that's 512 blocks -> 512 atomic operations. This is acceptable.\n\n   However, we can also use a two-step reduction without atomics? But that would require two kernels. We are trying to keep it simple.\n\n   We'll go with the atomic version.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   Note: We are to output the entire EVOLVE-BLOCK.\n\n   We must not change the class name: ModelNew.\n\n   We must keep the batch_size, input_shape, dim, get_inputs, get_init_inputs.\n\n   So the structure:\n\n        import ... (we add triton and tl)\n\n        @triton.jit\n        def mse_kernel(...):\n            ...\n\n        class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n            def __init__(self):\n                ...\n\n            def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n                ... (our new implementation)\n\n        batch_size = 128\n        input_shape = (4096, )\n        dim = 1\n\n        def get_inputs():\n            ...\n\n        def get_init_inputs():\n            ...\n\n   We are done.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"small iterative steps: Modify \u226420 lines per revision\". We are changing the forward method and adding a kernel -> that might be more than 20 lines? But the problem says we are allowed to replace the entire block.\n\n   We are replacing the entire block with a new implementation.\n\n   But note: the previous code was very short. We are adding a kernel and a new forward method.\n\n   We hope this is acceptable.\n\n   Let's write the code.\n\n   IMPORTANT: We must use the same device for the accumulator as the input.\n\n   We are using the device of predictions.\n\n   Now, we must note: the kernel must be compiled. We are using the autotuner? Not in this example, but we can add autotuning for BLOCK_SIZE? Actually, we are fixing BLOCK_SIZE to 1024. But note: the grid function uses meta['BLOCK_SIZE'] so that we can autotune.\n\n   We can add an autotuner? The problem says we can do adaptive tuning.\n\n   However, for simplicity, we start with 1024 and then we can autotune if needed? But the problem says we are to improve performance.\n\n   We'll leave it without autotuning for now? Actually, we can use a fixed block size.\n\n   But note: the problem says we are to get at least 5% speedup. The current PyTorch implementation is:\n\n        torch.mean((predictions - targets) ** 2)\n\n   This is already efficient? But we are replacing it with a Triton kernel that does the same with a parallel reduction and atomic_add. We hope it is faster.\n\n   However, note: the PyTorch implementation is also parallel and optimized. So we must be cautious.\n\n   Why might our kernel be faster?\n        - We are doing the entire operation in one kernel? PyTorch would do:\n            diff = predictions - targets   # one kernel\n            squared = diff ** 2            # another kernel\n            mean = squared.mean()          # another kernel (with reduction)\n\n        Our kernel does the subtraction, squaring, and the reduction per block in one kernel. Then we do a global reduction with atomic_add.\n\n        We are saving on the intermediate memory and kernel launch overhead.\n\n   So we hope it is faster.\n\n   We'll try.\n\n   If not, we can try to optimize further by using shared memory and a more efficient reduction? But tl.sum is already efficient.\n\n   We'll output the code.\n\n   Note: We are using Triton's atomic_add for float32. This is supported.\n\n   Code:\n\n        import math\n        import torch\n        import torch.nn as nn\n        import triton\n        import triton.language as tl\n\n        @triton.jit\n        def mse_kernel(pred_ptr, target_ptr, output_ptr, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr):\n            pid = tl.program_id(0)\n            start_idx = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n            offsets = start_idx + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n            mask = offsets < total_elements\n\n            # Load the data\n            pred = tl.load(pred_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n            target = tl.load(target_ptr + offsets, mask=mask, other=0.0)\n\n            # Compute squared difference\n            diff = pred - target\n            squared_diff = diff * diff\n\n            # Sum the squared differences in the block\n            block_sum = tl.sum(squared_diff, axis=0)\n\n            # Atomically add to the output\n            tl.atomic_add(output_ptr, block_sum)\n\n        class ModelNew(nn.Module):\n            def __init__(self):\n                super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n\n            def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n                # Flatten the tensors to 1D\n                predictions = predictions.contiguous().view(-1)\n                targets = targets.contiguous().view(-1)\n                total_elements = predictions.numel()\n\n                if total_elements == 0:\n                    return torch.tensor(0.0, device=predictions.device)\n\n                # Allocate a zero accumulator on the same device\n                accumulator = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=torch.float32)\n\n                # Define grid and block\n                # We use a fixed BLOCK_SIZE of 1024, but we can also make it a triton constant\n                grid = (triton.cdiv(total_elements, 1024), )\n                # Launch the kernel\n                mse_kernel[grid](predictions, targets, accumulator, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)\n\n                # Compute the mean\n                return accumulator / total_elements\n\n        batch_size = 128\n        input_shape = (4096, )\n        dim = 1\n\n        def get_inputs():\n            return [torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape), torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape)]\n\n        def get_init_inputs():\n            return []\n\n   However, note: the grid function in the launch uses a tuple for grid? We did: grid = (triton.cdiv(total_elements, 1024), )\n\n   Also note: the kernel expects the grid as a tuple of one element? Yes.\n\n   But we can also write:\n\n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(total_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']), )\n        ... and then in the launch: BLOCK_SIZE=1024\n\n   But we fixed the block size to 1024. Alternatively, we can use:\n\n        mse_kernel[grid](predictions, targets, accumulator, total_elements, BLOCK_SIZE=1024)\n\n   But we defined grid as (triton.cdiv(total_elements, 1024), ) -> that is a tuple.\n\n   Alternatively, we can use the grid function that takes meta? We don't need to because we are fixing the block size.\n\n   We'll go with the fixed block size.\n\n   However, note: the problem says we can do adaptive tuning. We can add autotuning for BLOCK_SIZE? But the problem says \"small iterative steps\". We can do that in a future step.\n\n   We output the code as described.\n\n   But note: we are importing math? We don't use it. We can remove it? But the original code didn't have it. We'll remove unless needed.\n\n   Actually, we don't need math.\n\n   We remove math.\n\n   Also note: the original code did not have triton and tl. We must import them.\n\n   We do.\n\n   Now, note: the kernel is defined at the top level. This is acceptable.\n\n   We write the code accordingly.\n\n   However, note: the problem says \"NEVER remove boundary checks or out-of-bound masks\". We have the mask in the load and the condition in the kernel.\n\n   We are safe.\n\n   Let's output the code.\n</think>\n```python\n# ================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-START ==================\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport triton\nimport triton.language as tl\n\n@triton.jit\ndef mse_kernel(\n    pred_ptr,\n    target_ptr,\n    output_ptr,\n    n_elements,\n    BLOCK_SIZE: tl.constexpr,\n):\n    pid = tl.program_id(axis=0)\n    block_start = pid * BLOCK_SIZE\n    offsets = block_start + tl.arange(0, BLOCK_SIZE)\n    mask = offsets < n_elements\n    \n    pred = tl.load(pred_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    target = tl.load(target_ptr + offsets, mask=mask)\n    \n    diff = pred - target\n    squared = diff * diff\n    block_sum = tl.sum(squared, axis=0)\n    tl.atomic_add(output_ptr, block_sum)\n\nclass ModelNew(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super(ModelNew, self).__init__()\n\n    def forward(self, predictions, targets):\n        predictions = predictions.contiguous().view(-1)\n        targets = targets.contiguous().view(-1)\n        n_elements = predictions.numel()\n        \n        if n_elements == 0:\n            return torch.tensor(0.0, device=predictions.device)\n            \n        output = torch.zeros(1, device=predictions.device, dtype=torch.float32)\n        grid = lambda meta: (triton.cdiv(n_elements, meta['BLOCK_SIZE']),)\n        \n        mse_kernel[grid](\n            predictions, targets, output, n_elements,\n            BLOCK_SIZE=1024,\n        )\n        return output / n_elements\n\nbatch_size = 128\ninput_shape = (4096, )\ndim = 1\n\ndef get_inputs():\n    return [torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape), torch.randn(batch_size, *input_shape)]\n\ndef get_init_inputs():\n    return []\n# =================== EVOLVE-BLOCK-END ===================\n```"]}}}
